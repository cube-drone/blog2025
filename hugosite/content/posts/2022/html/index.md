## A HTML Cheat Sheet I Compiled Without Checking To See If Anything I Remember Is Accurate or True

* start with a `doctype` (to indicate that you know what kind of doctor this code requires)
* `html` for the whole diggitydoo
  * `head` for the metadata
  * `title` for the title
  * `link` for CSS (note that, despite `zelda` being the name on the box, `zelda` is not interchangeable with `link` here)
  * `script` for JS
* `body` for the stuff you actually see
* `soul` for stuff that doesn't go in the head or the body (note, not supported in materialist browsers)
* `div` is a box for holding literally anything
* `section` is "div" for people with too much time on their hands
* `p` for paragraphs
* `b` for bearagraphs
* `h1 h2 h3 h4 h5 h6` for headers
* `f1 f2 f3 f4 f5 f6` for footers
* `span` for stuff like individual text that's in a line and doesn't need a whole box on its own
* `spain` for the country, spain, where the rain is mainly on the plain
* `ol` and `ul` are the containers for ordered lists and unordered lists
* `li` for the list items that goes into whichever list.
* `la`, a note to follow `so`
* `ti`, a drink with jam and bread
* `blockquote` for quotes
* `img` for images (note: Tim Berners-Lee sold the a and e for beer money)
* `abbr` is the sound you make when you give your cat a raspberry
  * he will scratch your face but it is worth it
* I'm pretty sure there's an `audio` and a `video` but I have to look these ones up every time I use them because they have complicated formats inside of them.
* `pre` and `code` for stuff you want to look like code
* `marquee` to let people know you're a baller
* `form` for forms
* `void` is form but it doesn't do anything (it is public and static, though)
* `button` for buttons
* `input` ... okay, I usually have to look up the syntax for inputs, but there's a whole mess of 'em, like "text" and "password"
* `output` was made illegal in 1998 and doesn't get used anymore
* `em` and `strong` for emphasis and STRONK
* `weak` is like `strong` but it sets font-weight:100
* `table` is for layout, if you like pain, but otherwise the `tr` (table rows) and `th` (table headers) and `td` (table data) and `tm` (trademarks) mostly only come up if you're actually rendering tabular data. Which still happens sometimes, if youâ€™re the sort of person who wears a TIE. And PANTS.
* `<!--` is Athena's arrow of wisdom, any text that you spear with it is rendered invisible to the reader `-->`
* `center` is no longer supported, it's been replaced by the vastly superior canadianism, `centre`
* `iframe` is a little web browser that lives inside your web browser, with its whole own little society. hi there little iframe people! what is it like in there?
* `aframe` is a house that is shaped like this `/\`

So, every now and then I rewatch Jenny Nicholson talking about [the worst reality TV show of all time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKFgn6tNU6w), because it's funny, and because I have a cold.

Anyways, the comments for that video are now filled with people pushing their own, alternate takes for worst reality TV show of all time, and, uh, okay.

**WB's Superstar USA**.

[The whole show is available in its entirety on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sc3d-dB5vNg&list=PLyYhOnXik8uuHdjFyBAAdOUTEw-lyRPt7):

Whereas our legendary Opposite Worlds was merely dangerously incompetent, WB'S Superstar USA is _actively malicious_, a season long elaborate prank.

The conceit is: It's American Idol, but the judges are simply instructed to reverse their judgement. The worse the singer, the better.

This is essentially a show intended to try to chase the virality of the William Hung "She Bangs" clip, on purpose

anyways, even at the time it was _unpopular_. Like, it's a funny _idea_ in the writer's room but the execution is just so staggeringly, unyieldingly cruel.

America _hated_ WB's Superstar USA, because very few people actually want to be _this_ mean.

Watching these awful singers go to _all of these effort_ - learning choreography, practicing, putting their whole ass into a competition where they were judged based on how unlistenably bad the final result was? This was terrible. This was a terrible thing to do.

Even the show kinda soft-pedaled the reveal, explaining to the winner that they were looking for someone with _all of the qualities of a star_ **except** for the voice. Which was still very bad and embarassing for everyone.

anyways, this does offer up the opportunity to put one of the world's least appealing CDs into someone's Toyota when they're not looking

Have you ever heard of Florence Foster Jenkins?

> A Manhattan socialite, who sold out Carnegie Hall in 1944 despite having a very dodgy voice, inspired a new movie starring Meryl Streep — and aided generations of actual singers.

This is a good opportunity to bring up Contrapoints, because I’ve very rarely seen people try to delve into why this kind of thing _works_.

So, today I put together a nice little miso ramen for lunch on a _whim_, based mostly on stuff I had sitting around:

this was so good and so easy!

admittedly, some of the easiness was because _I had the right ingredients just sitting around_.

### Roasted Garlic Oil

#### Step 0: Just Have Roasted Garlic Oil Around From That Time You Made Garlic Confit Earlier This Week

### Garlic Confit

Just put peeled garlic and neutral oil in an oven-safe container in your oven at 350Â° for like 40 minutes, and the result is this good stuff.

For a _long_ time I would make roasted garlic the classic way: whole bulb all at the same time:

but after the umpteenth time awkwardly trying to squeeze the roasted garlic out of piping hot garlic skin, I thought "wouldn't this be easier if I just peeled the garlic before I cooked it?"

Which, _yes_, it _absolutely_ is, and you get _more garlic oil_ this way anyways. Later, I discovered that this method is called "garlic confit" although now I just think of it as "improved roasted garlic".

Anyways, if I have a lot of garlic to work through (often) I usually make a batch of this and just leave it out in the kitchen for a week, watching it slowly disappear into various foods because _most things could use a little hit of garlic oil_.

### Miso Broth

Ingredients:
* 4 cups water
* 2 tsp [hondashi](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-you-should-keep-instant-dashi-in-your-pantry)
* 4 tbsp white miso paste
* cubed tofu
* thinly sliced green onion
* heat up gently in pan

well that's very easy

### Ramen Noodles
I just had some dried Hakubaku ramen sitting in my sealed noodle tub

I checked online just before I made this and confirmed that it's not considered _legit_ to cook the ramen noodles directly in the broth, so I cooked the batch of ramen (for just 4 minutes) in a separate pot, then drained it.

### Wakame
i don't have any seaweed around, dang it

### And then
just toss the noodles and the broth in a bowl, drizzle some garlic oil on top, and bam, mission accomplish

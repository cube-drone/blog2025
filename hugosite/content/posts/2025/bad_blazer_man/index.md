My dad is looking at moving to Penticton, and the home he’s been looking at is… well, its last occupants died, and now they haunt the place with dated design decisions.

Plum and yellow can work as a design ethos but it looks dingy, here.

> Futzing around on social media, as one does, I recently stumbled upon a meme that hit close to home. Over a picture-patterned sofa in an autumnal-colored velour with scrolling dark wood trim, it declared, “Everyone’s grandparents had this couch. Everyone’s.” I paused, because my grandmother did, in fact, have this exact type of couch.

ok, yes, but what **really** caught my attention was the realtor:

This be-soul-patched man has decided that the best way to sell a place in plum and yellow would be to BECOME the plum and yellow.

He’s careful to try and frame every shot of this home in front of one of the big windows because what sells this place is definitely the view and not the part on the inside.

I don't know what to say: if your realtor is not this dedicated to selling your home, you should stop working with them and
work with _this guy_ instead, he's clearly putting in the effort.

It's not even that easy to _find_ yellow pants.

> Let's imagine you need to crack together a world, or a story, or a video game.
>
> There are a few ways to start writing a story - with a story outline, or by doing impressive amounts of worldbuilding.
>
> The Groovelet: Portable Mythology is intended to help with either of these things, as a _creative exercise/aid_.

> ## Okay, but What IS It?
>
> The Groovelet: Portable Mythology describes a set of 12 interlinked archetypes, arranged on a wheel,
with a web of symbolic interconnection linking and unifying the 12 "spokes" of the wheel.
>
> 12 archetypes, grouped into 4 suits, each with themes, oppositions, and a role in a larger story
cycle, with contrasting elements arranged opposite from one another.
>
> Each archetype in the Groovelet pantheon is thematically unique, distinct, with a built-in conflict
with another Groovelet on the opposite side of the wheel.
>
> Think of this like someone rammed the Greek Gods, the Tarot, TVTropes, and the Dan Harmon Story
Cycle all together into one short, easy-to-read document.

## What is this?
Many games and game systems use the Tarot deck as a conflict
resolution mechanism, and many new game masters — and
writers — like to turn to the Tarot for inspiration.

The reason for this seems pretty clear: the Tarot deck contains
a lot of bold, memorable archetypes. It’s like a hundred-year-old
miniaturized version of TvTropes that you can roll out in order
to generate ideas on the fly. It’s a starting point to help stave off
the tyranny of the blank page.

This book is intended to serve as a starting-off point: what do
these cards mean? How might I use them in a role-playing game
or as writing inspiration?

For each card I try my best to describe the card’s interpretation,
as well as lay out some characters, hooks, locations, treasures,
and names that might be associated with that card in specific. A
lot of these interpretations are also very broad: I’m not here to
write your stories for you, just to give you some ideas to riff on.

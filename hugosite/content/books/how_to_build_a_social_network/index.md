Hi! This is a little microproject I want to do: I want to compress my years of experience building the API backend of a top-50 Steam game into a bunch of weird, rambling advice that I can deliver with all of the authority of someone who can't differentiate success due to merit from success due to luck.

This started as an idea for a presentation that I could give, in front of a slide deck, but it became a little imposing as it started to extend past 20,000 words and I realized that I'd be talking for over 3 hours. If it does seem a little brief in places, that's why: it was intended (naively) to be delivered in one unbroken sitting.

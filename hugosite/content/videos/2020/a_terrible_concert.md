This is an early build of a game engine was working on in 2020, designed to produce a procgen roguelike world.

If you watch how badly the chess games go you can see that the distributed gameplay logic engine didn't work so good.
_Distributed consistency is really hard you guys._

Honestly the procgen music engine wasn't... terrible. As procgen music engines go it's... on the verge of listenable.
If this were playing while I were wandering around in a forest for a long period of time I wouldn't be TOO MAD.

The goal was to create music that just ran forever in the background and never really drew attention to itself, which is kind
of where it's at.

I put a lot of effort into this "taking model-generated MIDI, using heuristic rules to sort it and apply structure to it, then running it through a
javascript in-browser synth" project, but not a year later models like Suno could generate _full pop songs_ so this
was basically obsolete before it ever launched.

Honestly, watching it go and listening to it is kinda charming.

Here's another, later concert from a slightly later build:

There's a little special song at 13:50 that is _one of the worst things the engine has ever composed_.

Whenever I played this for anybody who was at all interested in music they were actively mad at me for _doing this to music_.

This is a time-lapse of me very quickly demonstrating the entire, end-to-end process, by putting together an 18-card expansion deck in just under 3 hours.

> **2024 EDIT**: I built this game in 2022, before cheap, low-effort, and morally questionable AI art generation tools became broadly available to all of humanity. I did it using python scripts and legitimate, public data-sets of verifiable provenance, and put a lot of additional effort into the output and layout of the cards - and I've made the output available for free. Please do not come at me with "AI is prima facie immoral" unless you're willing to engage with this project on these terms.

> **2023 EDIT**: GOOD THING THAT THE WHOLE AI ART INDUSTRY DIDN'T CHANGE OVERNIGHT AND BECOME DRAMATICALLY EASIER FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS TO INTERFACE WITH EXACTLY FIFTEEN MINUTES AFTER I FINISHED THIS PROJECT, OR I'D HAVE FELT LIKE A REAL SCHMUCK

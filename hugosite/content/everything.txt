[Skip To The Visual Novel](https://comics.cube-drone.com/capilano/index.html)

So, _funny story_.

I’ve been experimenting with storytelling tools for a while. That’s what my last post was about: storytelling tools and dialogue systems. That post was MONTHS ago. We’ve come a long way since then.

I’ve always wanted to make graphic novels, but, unfortunately, I have pretty mediocre art and writing and discipline skills: instead of becoming a better artist or writer, my plan is to simply wow people as best as I can with technological superiority.

And what I realized, eventually, was that I was … just kind-of building a Visual Novel engine.

After digging way in to Godot and building some node-based scene structures in there, with animated text and dialogue puppets, I was even more convinced: I think I really am building a Visual Novel engine.

So, given that, it was time to finally **just go try RenPy. Seriously, there’s a well-liked tool for this kind of thing already**.

_Worst case scenario you learn a bunch of stuff._

And, you know what? [RenPy](https://www.renpy.org/) had just about every feature I had wanted to build, already. It’s done. It’s a complete product. It lacks some of the high-end features I was building towards in Godot - namely: skinnable, animated puppets and text animations that are controllable down-to-the-letter - but it HAS features that I need and haven’t even started working on yet, like transition effects, menus, and conditional statements.

**Neat.**

So, my wife goes out of town to visit her mom. I stay home to take care of our cat - and in my boredom and loneliness I watch some old episodes of Columbo.

You know, because the recent show “Poker Face” was just Rian Johnson writing a love letter to old episodes of Columbo - after watching 10 episodes of Natasha Lyonna expertly pulling her imitation of the Peter Falk Shuffle, I just had to revisit the original.

* [Intense Columboposting: Part 1](/posts/2023/columbo)
* [Intense Columboposting: Part 2](/posts/2023/columbo_lady_in_waiting)

As a result of learning about RenPy and shotgunning several consecutive episodes of Columbo, I make a little pledge to myself:

**I’m going to make an episode of Columbo into a RenPy visual novel.**

Now, at the time, July 11th, I figure “this is going to be easy”. No problem. Ezpz. I will be done in 2 weeks. (I honestly thought this: I am a fool. )

I did some basic experimentation with it: WASM web export seems to work fine, I could even run the WASM website on my phone, it seemed like a slam dunk.

This is another thing I’ve been doing lately, but I’ve been developing projects in the awful, awful 19.5:9 vertical aspect ratio of phones when I work on… any new project.

The idea is, I think, is that it presents an unpleasant but acceptable interface for web users, but pretty verifiably looks good on phones.

Now, finally, instead of endlessly building tools, it’s my responsibility to sit down and just grind out some damn content.

And… grind I did!

I learned the basics of RenPy and sat down to pump out a script. I based it very, very heavily off of “**Death Lends a Hand**”, a fan-favorite episode.

I also, almost immediately, wandered way, way off-script. Certain elements bear a passing similarity to Death Lends a Hand, but the final script ended up almost impossibly weirder.

“Detective Capilano”. I couldn’t just outright put actual TV character Columbo into my script, this is not fanfic, this is… serial-numbers-filed-off LEGIT fanfic, and so Detective Susan Capilano is named after - well, Joe Capilano, famous Squamish and namesake to many British Columbia landmarks and institutions. Sure, it may raise a lot of complicated questions to name a character after an indigenous leader, but in my defense, “Capilano” is very close, phonetically, to “Columbo”, while also being a tie-in to something that’s personally meaningful to me.

The final product also ended up… long. Quite long. Reading the entire script, end-to-end, took about 45 minutes, which would make my script about as long as an episode of Columbo. Just writing things took about two weeks. I thought I’d be done the whole project in two weeks, but no, that was just words. (Keep in mind, I have a day job that I’m quite good at, I get about 2 hours a day of Personal Project Time, so, maybe 28 hours total for the full script.)

After the script it came time for sound. Most of the SFX design just came from the eternally useful freesound.org , but I was struggling to find a collection of truly usable free, soundtrack-appropriate, royalty free music - until I bumped into the collection at incompetech.com, which was absolutely sufficient to the project I was trying to build. Not perfect - I would LOVE to be able to compose my own music, but it’s not a skill I have in the tank, and I’m not going to commission a musician with real money when the stakes are a free RenPy game, that’s a bad life decision.

Sound went relatively quickly.

Then, finally, art. Ho, boy. I kept this story dirt simple: maybe 6 major locations and 10 named characters.

Scene backdrops were prepared in chalk outline on a black background: this scratchy, lo-fi background can be completed very quickly, and I think looks distinctive.

![](./bg.png)

Even with the obvious simplicity of the art style, I cooked up about 30 of these, maybe 3 an hour, for 10 hours, which (remembering I have about 2 hours a day to work on this) ate another whole week.

And that brings us to the final phase, character art.

I had been looking forward to this for weeks. And… after finishing my first few shots, it turned into as much of a slog as the rest of the project. I didn’t want to do the “baby’s first VN” move of just having a handful of cards per character - I wanted to do some acting, especially with our main character, Detective Capilano.

I ended up with **79**, count-em, SEVENTY NINE _different poses_ for Detective Capilano.

To be honest, the whole story bounces through about 7-8 main Capilano poses, like “attentively listening while holding a notepad” and “hmmmm” which amount to about 75% of any given detective’s milieu, but then sometimes I’d need a really, really specific pose to make a joke land or to tell some of the story visually.

Like, this happens exactly once, in the story, but it’s an IMPORTANT SNIFF:

![](./sniff.png)

Most of the other characters have 8-12 poses, and I also included images for all of the 23 collectible items in the game, for a total of about 200 separate units of character art.

Again, even at the prodigious and lazy pace that I generate art, that’s a lot of raw ART asset, and it took me about 3 weeks to power through that big pile of art assets.

And then… I was done!

I mean, sure, there’s probably an aggressive polish pass I can do on this game, but it’s a visual novel I slapped together in a hurry: it’s not going to magically turn into a viable product with a huge userbase. You couldn’t pay most people to interact with a visual novel. _I’m pretty happy with it, where it is._

Finally, it came time to give it its final name:

![](./longtitle.png)

[It's completely playable, here](https://comics.cube-drone.com/capilano/index.html).

I _highly_ recommend downloading it, RenPy does not do well in the browser.

And the launch was ready: I announced the game on Mastodon, on Twitter, and of course in the #side-projects channel at work. That’s about as big a launch as I can muster.

As a result, as many as… let me check my CDN analytics… 20 people played the game. (The numbers are up, it was 17 people, yesterday!) Oh, and because assets are downloaded as you go, I can also see how far each of those players got. Exactly one person has made it to the end.

If you’re curious what working this hard on a project and having just the one person finish it feels like, it’s not great.

![](./kiki.webp)

I wasn’t expecting a lot of reception for a visual novel - generally they’re quite unpopular and amateurish. You can’t **pay** people to play them. It’s like asking someone to _play your RPG Maker game, or read your unpublished novel_: they’re not doing it because it’s going to be good. At **best** they’re doing it as a favor to you.

Even so, though, I was surprised at how emotional I was to ship something, again, that nobody really gave a shit about. I do this pretty often: ship half-baked, barely operational projects with zero marketing and no word of mouth, then look at my big ol’ bowl of Nobody Gives a Shit and cry literal actual tears for a few hours.

Just making things randomly and refusing to polish or market them, but hoping to receive a lot of attention and acclaim - my head understands this is a bad strategy, but I don’t fully understand it in my **heart**.

But, like always, I got over it in about a day. Being done with this frees me up to work on my _next_ stupid thing!

Anyways, it’s out there, now! It’s released! I can still drive traffic to it, it gets to keep being a thing I built, and it’s going to stay online for years and years because, unlike some of my more ambitious projects, it costs me essentially _nothing_ to host.

**2025 Editor's Note:** This segment was unnecessarily dour. While Detective Capilano is a little more meandering than I'd hope, I went through it again not 2 years later and found it charming and funny, and I'm glad I made it. Sure, it was for a small audience, but for what is _essentially_ my first ever graphic novel it's not fuckin' bad.

----

## Learning!

So, I have interesting takeaways.

### WASM Considered Harmful

One of the first ones is that you **can’t really target mobile device browsers with WebAssembly applications reliably**. One of the things I’ve been trying to accomplish with these projects is to get something running that I can just give people an iPhone link to, and have it load and work seamlessly without having to go through any app stores or verification processes. Both Godot and RenPy offer WebAssembly builds of their product, and **both Godot and RenPy have big, nasty, gamebreaking bugs on iOS, that I didn’t discover until I was already working with them**.

Godot 4.0 has more than one, right now, most of them which the team have determined are upstream iOS problems that they can’t easily fix. The Godot 4.0 problems, though, at least had the decency to prevent the application from loading at all.

RenPy simply allows players to get about a third of the way through the game and then collapses with an out-of-memory error. This is very bad, and I didn’t catch it in my early prototyping phase. How could I? Toy projects didn’t use enough RAM to crash the browser. And now that I know that can and will happen, well, I expect it’s pretty likely to happen in Godot, as well, if I give it a sufficiently complex project.

I don’t have an Android device to test with at the moment but I imagine it wouldn’t be great, either.

This article, [WebAssembly needs a better memory management story](https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/1397), goes into some of the reasons why trying to fit WASM apps into browser memory is currently something of a shit-show.

So, that’s unfortunate. With RenPy broken on iOS mobile, my game’s intended phone-sized form factor doesn’t serve nearly as much of a purpose. I mean, I could pay $99/year to get it on the App Store, but… I’m not going to do that for a free visual novel. The economics of paying Apple so that I can give unpopular applications away for free just doesn’t work out for me.

In fact, if I want things to execute reliably in all contexts, I think the choice is obvious: I need to go back to good ol’ Javascript in the browser. This brief flirtation with game engines was fun, but if what I want is for people to jump in with links, I’ve gotta go more lo-fi.

### My Fiction Writing: Only Okay

I’ve been staring at this game non-stop for weeks, so I’ve lost all objectivity, but I think the low clearance rate speaks to the fact that this detective story can really draaaag.

I made sure that it works, mechanically, as a detective story: you, a reasonable human being, should be able to solve the thing, with the clues given. I like that.

I also packed this game with stupid jokes and even dumber film and music references. I like that too.

A lot of the bones, though, of good fiction writing - motivation, character, compelling scenes with high stakes - well, I know what those things ARE and I try my best to deliver on them, but I think this story could have stood to be half as long and twice as tight.

Which actually, brings me to my next point:

### 45-60 Minutes is Too Long

A 45-minute-long story is much, much too long. Most of the people who visited Detective Capilano’s website looked at the description, read “45 minute to 1 hour visual novel with SOUND”, thought “I can’t read that on the bus”, and bailed immediately, and I understand. That’s too LONG. I don’t want to commit to a 45-minute-long anything, unless I know it’s going to be worth my time.

On top of that, the sheer length of it made every part of its production drag on, and on, and on, and on. I basically cooked up a teeny tiny little community theatre play under my own power.

The story also has very limited interactivity, and no gameplay - partially because it’s hard to make a story this long with actual branching paths.

What I want is nice, tight, 5-minute experiences. Easy to build, with a small brain-burner of a real, actual puzzle in each one. Now that’s something I might be able to get people to sink their teeth in to, and something where I might be able to turn around the whole product on a tighter timeline.

I read a little blog post, a while ago, that made the point that indie creators who are looking to experiment wildly, polish their skillset, and learn to ship reliably should consider making **Way More, Complete, Very Short Games**, and I took that to heart - but I’m still making the games too big.

### I’m Not 100% Sure What I’m Building Next

I have a whole notepad full of ideas, as usual, but we’ll see. WE’LL SEE.

### Finally

If you have 45 minutes to kill, headphones, and are curious, [try the game, here](https://comics.cube-drone.com/capilano/index.html). If you want, write a long report of all of your thoughts and feelings and send it to me: I will read every word. Play it with a friend and voice the parts, and record it for the whole internet. Get weird. Play it for two minutes, get bored, and quit. Do whatever you like!

If you’re sitting at a PC, you’ll probably have a slightly better experience if you just download the PC build rather than trying to play it on the web - every image loads instantly rather than getting pulled from the CDN, it shaves milliseconds off your play-through time and feels much smoother, plus it won't crash halfway through due to a memory issue!

For some absolutely asinine reason I have smart lights in my house.

(I can tell you why: it started when we realized that the previous inhabitants' genius electrical work would turn the furnace off if the basement lights were switched off, so we either needed to rewire it or, cheaper, get lights that would switch off independently of the light switch)

There are, unfortunately, no smart buttons that aren't battery powered, so I made the mistake of buying some on-sale Alexa speakers.

![](./tea.png)

Amazon's smart speaker platform is _juuust_ smart enough that with a little bit of effort (about 4 hours of techno-faffing), I could get it to play an icecast stream by using a soon-to-be-deprecated developer API.

Getting my icecast radio station hooked up was a pain in the ass, but even more of a pain in the ass was finding activation phrases that were:

* Unique enough that they wouldn't trigger unwanted behavior
* Pronounceable enough that Alexa could reliably parse them.

Because "marquee.click" is my personal domain for Various Shenanigans, my first crack at this was the activation phrase "marquee radio" which had something like a 5% success rate.

Most of the time when I said "Alexa, play marquee radio", Alexa would hear "Alexa, play mariachi radio", and as much as I like non-stop mariachi tunes, it's not what I asked for.

Currently the activation phrases are

* "Alexa, buttery nunchucks" ( for my main radio station, https://radio.marquee.click)
* "Alexa, cascading bumblebees" ( for https://radio.marquee.click/chill.ogg )
* "Alexa, unbelievably boring" (podcasts)

these, of course, only work within my home: it's in dev mode, I probably couldn't get my radio stations through certification, being as I do not have the legal right to rebroadcast this music (I _paid_ for the mp3s, but the radio station is for personal use)

-----

So, I have basically perfect Machine Voice: Alexa always listens to me and interprets what I have to say correctly. This infuriates my wife, who tends towards angrily shout-mumbling at the device ("LEXA! LIGHSOFF!") and then getting _more_ angry when it doesn't do shit

My wife has an unusual pan-American accent borne from being a military kid, but she's not unclear: instead I think she's just kinda mad that the device expects clear enunciation and refuses to play it's game, whereas I'm so in love with the sound of my own voice I can't help but go "Alexa, could you please turn the lights off in the living room?"

I've got the device vibe a little better than she does. That's not to say it isn't VERY OFTEN just, like, 15% dumber than I want it to be.

A good question to ask Alexa is "what do you think I just said?" because it will often provide some context for a completely nonsensical response.

------

The pile of watch-battery-powered smart buttons have gradually worked their way into the trash. They churn through those batteries at a pretty prodigious rate, fail often, and they _don't feel good to press_.

I also won't wire things directly into the house, on the assumption that smart tech is garbage and won't last longer than the house will.

I've thought of cheap tablet or raspberry pi shit, but ugh

If someone out there knows of a plug-in-to-the-wall smart button platform out there, lmk+++

if you have 10 fingers, you have an above average number of fingers

while an average person will have 10 fingers, the global average for number of fingers is probably in the realm of 9.9999999... on account of more people having lost fingers than folks with extras (thanks, fireworks), which means that anybody with a full set is a teeny tiny fraction above the average

a lot of people think that it's not possible for more than half of people to be above average:

it's not intuitive

but if you have 10 people take a test, and 9 of them get an A, and 1 of them gets an F, then the average is just a little below an A and everybody who got an A is above average: 90% of people scored above average, 10% of people scored below average.

reddit decided _yes_

It's unlikely to happen, but were I to have a kid, I'd keep my [tragedeigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/)
desires confined to their middle name, which can be as silly and stupid as I want
(is there a cap on number of middle names? no? great.), because they're basically vestigial.

My wife and I both have names in the sweet spot (rare enough to be unique to an arbitrary group of 100 people, usually, but common enough not to be interesting or stand out in any way) and I'd want my kid to have the same experience, name-wise.

like, you want them to be a Vincent in a sea of Micheals and Johns and Noahs and Olivers - you should be able to think "I know 1-2 persons with that name, but not dozens, but also that is not the first time I have ever heard anybody use that name ever"

**AWS** has launched a coffee shop

instead of paying for the whole cup, you pay for each component

the beans are competitively priced for the industry, but they make it up on water and sugar

also if you leave the cafe with your coffee in hand they charge you $130,000

-----

**redis** has launched a coffee shop

from inside AWS's coffee shop

so you get the privilege of paying both AWS and redis for the same coffee

although the recipe is just available online for free

-----

**cloudflare** has launched a coffee shop

you can drink as much coffee as you want for ten dollars a month, which seems like a good deal, but if you start to depend on it they will find you and muscle you into paying tens of thousands of dollars a month

for coffee

there's a thought that starts to come to mind when  you've been cooking for a long time, which is "i could make that, cheaper, at home" , which is a rewarding thread to pull on, it turns out

pandemic forced me to learn to cook a bunch of stuff that I only ever ate at restaurants - butter chicken, pad thai, sushi, fried chicken, onion rings - and, like, it turns out, while I still eat out periodically, being excited about your own cooking is So Good

I'm not devoted enough to press my own california rolls, but just making a bowl of sushi rice and topping it with some shredded imitation crab, mayo, sesame seeds, cucumber and avocado is a delicious california donburi and so easy

this is a challenge.

you: reading this: what's the take-out meal you love most in the world? What is the restaurant you wish you were at this very moment?

I swear to you, you CAN learn to make something at home that's almost as good, you can eat it once a week for the rest of your life for a tiny fraction of the cost, why not do that?

I'm going to put a little star next to a few things like "puff pastry", though, you should not make that at home+++

if you can back-of-the-envelope this stuff and get it even remotely in the right ballpark that is _fine_, just give them _something_

look, kid, I KNOW that all software development is custom and all custom work is unpredictable, that's like the first thing we all learn, just give the blazers-and-golden-retrievers a dang t-shirt size for that login screen and we'll figure it out as we go

part of my job remains explaining to people that MongoDB and JavaScript are good, actually

a thing that, after many years, I well and truly believe, now

no, really! they're good! there have been instances in the past of them not being good but they actually can be used to build very impressive services at scale!

you have to learn to write MongoDB like you would Cassandra/Scylla/Dynamo a little bit, though

the thing you lose going to Mongo from a SQL database is "joins", but - if you're building a system that needs to write-scale, you're not going to be able to use joins anyways, joins won't work across shards, so maybe you should be considering "only application side joins and as few of them as possible" from the get-go anyways

of course, "building with scale in mind from the outset" is a bad strategy for most products because honestly:
the chance any given product is going to NEED to scale that big is like 1/1000, most companies literally just need POSTGRES and then SQL already has decades of lore and understanding and tooling behind it

_use postgres, dummy_

but the fact that we started with Mongo and built with Mongo and now have a product that's on Mongo is not a bad thing, and is, in fact, better than if we had a hugely interconnected SQL database that we had to try to unknot every time write performance against a table became a problem

each individual Mongo collection is an utterly self-contained entity that can live on a completely different server, if necessary

did you know you can just take a problem table and move it to its whole own cluster? it's expensive but try and do that with something that has a load of joins pointed at it and you'll discover why that's not often a viable strategy in SQL land

and you know what? Mongo's schemaless, flexible design and easy post-hoc application of indexes to remedy slow queries? that creates a pretty buttery smooth experience to develop an experimental new product with.

In lots of systems, you don't need a load of joins anyways: do you really ACTUALLY have a lot of relationships or does everything just have the single back-link to a "userId"?

In many cases, you have nested relationships, like a TodoGroup filled with Todos, but

_wait a minute, that can just be a nested object, sharded by userId._

As for JavaScript, most of the haters are hating on the JavaScript of 2004 and a couple of NaN memes they saw once. Digging in nowadays, JS is, IMO, equivalent in its power and expressiveness to Python, but with a much clearer model for cooperative multitasking. Not a lot of folks out there hating on Python.

“Oh, template based inheritance is bad” yeah, well, so are deeply nested inheritance hierarchies which are basically impossible to build in JS thanks to its comparatively slim object model.

I will say that I’m not in love with TypeScript: if you want strict, static typing there are languages that do it way, way better, why not just use one of those? C#, or Rust, or Kotlin, or hell, just admit you’re a Java developer.+++

man, for a protocol that doesn't seem like it has much of a defense against random bullshit from third party outsiders, [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)'s moderation (on my instance, at least) is pretty tight.

Sometimes I'll see someone blast loud garbage everywhere on a popular tag like "canada" from an account they just made on a reliable instance or an homemade server, and then minutes later they've been lasered from orbit.

either their reliable instance got them, or MY reliable instance got them, or their server was completely defederated

when I first looked, I thought "this has all of the same problems as email, there is no way this doesn't immediately devolve into the spammiest spam ever to spam a spam"

but actually, the layered silo approach means that there are lots of opportunities to catch a predator if you merely have loads of people pouring a lot of effort into it, all the time

i am very surprised that this all works and I suspect that the thing holding it all together is "effort", so remember to kick some money towards your silo admin if they've made it an option (they probably have, go check)

I went October camping (widely considered to be a bad idea this deep into the fall) and I was counting on climate change to make it practical - which it did.

_actually fall camping is really great, cool and crisp and nice_

some of the simplest and most satisfying dishes I know are ones where salt and pepper do almost all of the heavy lifting

poached eggs on toast? that's a salt and pepper dish

kraft dinner? nope, that's a cracked black pepper pasta with a hint of cheez flavor

back when I could eat cheese, sometimes I'd just crack a mountain of black pepper into some goat cheese and that's it, that's all you need to do, it's amazing+++

One of the problems with maintaining your own personal cookbook is that you just memorize how to cook most things, so mostly your recipe book just needs to be a handful of ratios, instructions for more complex and easy-to-forget recipes, and just a list of the things you know how to cook to remind you of all of them when you're looking for inspiration.

the compressed form of a lot of #cooking recipes just calls for the ratio of the primary ingredients: all I need to know to make fried fish or tempura is "1 cup flour, 1 egg, 1 1/3 cup beer" because I can scale and season as necessary and remember that if I want a lighter batter I can swap the beer for club soda

that is to say, my whole personal cookbook is about 4 pages long and contains just under 60 recipes, many of them just single-word descriptions like "caldo verde"

the recipe for "caldo verde" is just the words "caldo verde", there to remind me that I like to cook that thing, the rest is just Draw The Rest of the Owl

Lately it seems there's a tonne of anti-anti-natalist discourse in the conservative sphere, like "how dare women decide not to have children, where will new children even come from, what's wrong with people that they don't want big families anymore" but i'm not sure what huge baby shortage they are talking about, it seems like there are plenty of fuckin' people, which makes me think that this has always just been a racist dogwhistle because the babies being born are the _wrong ones_ I guess?

![](./population.png)

_everyone knows that the only babies that matter are the ones your millennial daughter-in-law are not having, how dare she_

**there are loads of people**

if someone has a one-in-a-million mental disorder you could still find 8000 people like that and put them on the same website

how else would you explain [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org)?

"Hey, gang, let's see who this 'millennials aren't family oriented enough' discourse is coming from!"

![](./scoob-1.png)

"why it was old man white supremacy all along"

I guess, in a different direction, calling anybody who doesn't have kids for whatever reason "anti-natalist" is wrong, on account of actual anti-natalists being _real weird_.

I don't want kids, but I'm not an anti-natalist.

Hardcore anti-natalists appear to believe that anyone having children At All is on the face of it evil, and believe in the voluntary extinction of the human race, it's actually an extremely Overwrought Anime Villain belief system.

"Existence contains suffering, ergo, making people exist is doing violence to them." is an extremely "I am going to have a second boss-phase where I grow wings and deal massive extra damage" kind of philosophy.

It's fine to want to have kids and to have kids. It's fine to not want to have kids and not to have kids.+++

I like e-scooters - they're fun, practical, and much easier than a bike to be polite with (at low speeds it’s extremely easy to control and dismount, so the chance of getting in a crash is very low and it’s quite easy to give people loads of space). I also see myself as something of an ambassador for them: look, everyone, it’s absolutely possible to use these things responsibly.

I think that widespread e-scooter use would be, on average, very good: anything that means fewer cars on the road is a significant improvement. Most of the people who hate e-scooters have never tried riding one.

The average person’s opinion (see: reddit, town hall meetings) of e-scooters and e-bikes is quite low, though, because most of them are “teenagers or busy delivery workers given access to a much too powerful lightweight vehicle without any training or licensing”.

Part of that is that scooters really shouldn’t be going higher than 25-30km/h, average bike speeds. That’s tough to regulate, though, because people can claim that they’re not buying them to use on public roads. (Speed limiters, in general, are tough to regulate.)

Let's imagine that in order to participate in a raffle, you needed to construct an entire 3-story house from the ground up including plumbing, electrical, and finishing work, entirely in your spare time.

If you did a _pretty good job on the house_, that's not good enough: lots of people are out there building houses with whole crews, in order to stand out _your_ house has to be somehow exceptional.

Then, once you finished, you got one raffle ticket, and when you look to see who else got a ticket, there is one for every person in the entire city of Tsawwassen, British Columbia.

They're going to do maybe 10 draws, so good luck!

Now, you see this system and you decide to devote both your entire life and large amounts of your emotional state to not just participating in this draw, but winning.

Did, uh, did nobody explain to them that black-and-red crossed hammers are overt white supremacist symbols? Like, VERY prominently?

It started with their use in The Wall, and like other satire intended to mock white supremacists,
they missed the satire, _thought it looked cool and adopted it_.

Did Tilley just decide "it's time to appeal to the stormfront demo"?

you know Godel's Incompleteness Theorem? The idea that any consistent formal system is incapable of proving all truths?

I think that I believe that something similar exists for formal type systems: for each of them there are concepts that are useful but inexpressible

anyways Rust's type system has conspired to make something that seems like it should be simple: async functions in object traits - seemingly impossible, and apparently this remains an unsolved probelm

uh, suffice to say, the fine details of this intelligent strangers' blog entry mostly go above my tiny peanut head and I just read "it's stupendously difficult for a lot of complex type safety reasons, and there's a macro that makes it possible using devil magic"

I love breakfasts. One of the things I could not get enough of in Montreal was that they had a breakfast restaurant on seemingly every corner and they all executed at a level utterly unheard of in BC. Hell, even a Smittys does a better breakfast than you're likely to find in the lower mainland.

In my new place I live near a Cora, an IHOP and a De Dutch, all staffed by bored, laconic teenagers. Trying to get food in any of them on a weekend is a fool's errand and a 2 hour project at least.

I'm a not incompetent chef and at least a few times when guests have offered to take us to breakfast I've simply made an elaborate breakfast because it's a more efficient use of my time. It's not a perfect system because not everybody can order exactly what they like: you're getting a full English and you're going to LIKE IT darn it - but it's absolutely faster.

But there are some good spots (also: if you've got great BC breakfast restaurant tips let me know), one of which is the New Westminster IHOP.

Unlike most IHOPs it's actually - and this is weird - run well, by people who seem to like what they're doing? Maybe it pays well enough not to suffer massive turnover. I can hope, at least.

The difference is night and day. They're always busy, even on weekdays, and they turn over tables with mechanical efficiency.

All of us have hit a Denny's at a weird hour, been one of only two tables in the entire restaurant, and sat 75 minutes waiting for our order to slowly roll out, cold, from the kitchen, or been at that same Dennys when they're busy and had breakfast take an eternity because they're swamped and don't know what to do.

This IHOP is reliably full and even with every table packed your meal hits your table in under 15 minutes.

That is a short order chef firing on all cylinders.

I am hungry and impatient, and fascinated with restaurant efficiency. I love it in restaurants high and low end.

I particularly like peering into the bowels of a McDonalds, it's hardly a restaurant at all, it feels like watching a food operating system in motion.+++

## Tent & Sleepin'
* tent
   * if the tent has piddly little plastic stakes, _buy some metal stakes online_
* foamgrid (yoga foam grid makes the floor less pointy, optional)
* inflatable mattress, cots, or sleeping pads
* sleeping bags
* pillows
* clothing
* rain coat
* portable battery pack (for recharging devices, lights) with lots of usb-C and usb-micro cables
* little broom (tidy up that tent, it's gonna get dusty in there)
* toothbrush, toothpaste, floss
* disposable pocket cloth & sanitizer

### Setting Up a Chill Zone
* canopy
   * you should stake down the canopy as well, this is another reason why a small bag of your own stakes is handy
* folding chairs
* lights
  * it's nice to have one lamp per person, plus a hanging lamp for the inside of your tent, and a few lights to hang at the periphery of your canopy or put on your picnic table
  * these are a lot less necessary if you're not night owls and you're camping in the summer when it's not dark until 9PM anyways

### The Cooking Matrix
> putting a "complete" camp-kitchen set together is one of the harder parts, I built a big disorganized-but-complete plastic tub that I keep in storage
> you can buy elaborate _camping cookware sets_ online for too much money but I just tossed some kitchen extras and spares in a big tub, heavier but cheaper

* propane & stove
* paper towel roll
* aluminum foil roll
* kitchen garbage bags
* plates
* cups
* a pot
* a pan
* tongs
* spatula
* a cooking knife (use one of your shittiest at home knives, pack _carefully_)
* a cutting board
* soap, dishrack, sponge & basin
* oil
* salt & pepper
* sugar
* a l'il extra fold-up side table
* water jug (bring water from home, camp water may not be potable)
* kettle
* coffee & tea bags

### Kitchen Zone Doesn't Mean Nothin' Without
* a cooler, full of _food_
* I fill mine with _reusable ice packs_ rather than loose ice, which is less good at maintaining chill but more convenient
* vegetables & fruits (I have an insulated bag that I use for these, they don't need to stay SO COOL but keeping them from roasting in the heat is probably good)
* snacks & dry goods in a tub

### What Do You Do While Camping (I Mostly Do Stuff I Would Do Indoors)
* book
* games
* notepad?
* small bluetooth speaker to play at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11

### Utility
* hatchet
* tarps
* clamps
* rope
* duct tape
* lighter (long-neck)
* first aid kit
* can of bug spray
* fire-roastin' stick

### Further Nerdery
* this can be logistically complicated to get together - prepare a pre-launch checklist that includes steps like "fill water jug", "charge lamps", "pack food", etc..

### This Seems like a Lot Of Stuff

learn this powerful mantra: "that's a problem for future me"

If you're in [`#canada`](https://mastodon.social/tags/Canada) and you're curious about how to forge a closer relationship with local food supply, consider looking for Community Supported Agriculture programs in your area.

You pay in advance and get vegetables all year at their respective harvest times.

It's more expensive, inconvenient, and fussy than just buying your vegetables from Loblaw's, and you still need to buy vegetables from the store when you need Specific Vegetables, BUT big plastic tubs full of fresh veggies.

Lots of downsides to getting food from an actual farm, like: instead of getting the same 8 vegetables you get on repeat from the local store, the availability and supply of different vegetables changes a lot month after month, and I've had to pull some tradwife farm-ass shit like "dealing with an absolute mountain of plums" and "learning to pickle".

Also sometimes they will attempt to send you radicchio, which I think should be considered a war crime.

However: a couple of years of being forced to get creative with a hyper-local bounty of unpredictable farm fresh vegetables have, I think, forged me into a much more capable and resilient home chef.

It's really funny because every now and again I will go to Savio Volpe, which is one of the hot ticket local restaurants, and I'll see the same vegetables I'm dealing with on their endlessly rotating menu, because they're pulling a version of the same vegetable swindle I am, trying to get their mitts on the freshest and most local veg.

They, uh, reliably do a much better job with these vegetables than I do.

I'm not actually 100% convinced that there's much, if any, of a flavor or health benefit to these locally sourced vegetables compared to the actually reliably excellent bounty from a local vegetable store like Kin's - expensive vegetables are mostly just _vegetables_.

The health benefit is more, I think, being forced to cook a large plastic tub full of vegetables on the regular.

anyways, I've been a member of the [metro vancouver Glen Valley CSA](glenvalleycsa.com/home) for 2 years, now, and it's also quite a bit more well run than the last CSA I was a member of.

_also, and this is only a bonus if you're an idiot like me and lack long-term object permanence, paying a lot up front makes it feel like you're getting free vegetables from a genie_+++

Look, Cheetos and Doritos are puffed cornmeal dusted with MSG and carefully hand-optimized in a lab to be just unsatisfying enough that you'll rip through the whole bag without thinking about it.

Hawkins Cheezies are like crunching down on angry rocks hosed down with sharp cheddar. Each handful of Cheezies has more condensed Cheez flavor than a whole bag of Cheetos combined. You have to stop eating them out of sheer flavor exhaustion.

They use a 70-year old machine to crank these out and only a handful of people know the recipe, which hasn't changed since before my father was born.

about once every ten thousand years, the prophecy states a frontend developer will realize that they spend most of their time carefully using RPCs to curate a little miniature in-client database in order to keep their UI data up-to-date and sane,

These solutions tend to be so powerful that they make simple applications like the well known Todo App seem almost magically trivial

but the black-box, complex and highly bespoke nature of these solutions keeps them niche: RPC over HTTP is a well-understood model for a reason, it's much harder to reason about access control or rate limiting in a Custom Sync Protocol made by Some Guy

it's even worse when, once every ten thousand years, a backend developer decides that they will refuse to learn Javascript and end up inventing some fabulously, wildly elaborate system to write everything in a unified environment

So far, a lot more than Mastodon, I'm noticing that the people on Lemmy are people who _do not understand why they have been banned from reddit_

which means that while the dream of federation is in and of itself just, reddit itself might have to get bad enough to drive away some adults before lemmy is fully usable

As a little treat post-US-election I let myself subscribe to `r/LeopardsAteMyFace` again, but as much as I enjoy the handful of cherry-picked "I voted Republican then lost my job to a Republican" stories, they're ultimately kind of meaningless.

The  "I voted for someone to do cruelty and then they did it to me" stories serve the same kind of dark lizard brain urge as the other subreddits for watching people make stupid decisions and then suffer.

The content doesn't have to be accurate, or _new_, or true, or really anything more than a pithy headline that's fun to say. I'll make one up right now: "Man who voted for mass deportations is deported by accident" - ha ha! Isn't that kind of satisfying to think about? Mmm, karmic retribution.

But the buyer's remorse for Trump in the USA hasn't set in at all, really: his approval rating remains imposingly high. His terrible agenda is popular: Americans crave fascism.

Following that kind of content will give you a false impression that justice will be done, that stupid, needless cruelty contains the seeds of its own destruction, that the USA will realize it is hurting itself and improve.

But karma doesn't actually exist.

Worse, I think, that impulse to enjoy bad things happening to stupid people is actually wrought of the same nasty impulses that brought us here in the first place. That's why I always leave that subreddit before long.+++

I went to the local symphony orchestra last night, and it was nice

but I am left wondering what an orchestra is meant to accomplish, nowadays

so many people playing at the same time accomplishes big, room-filling sound, and it's the only way to accurately experience some compositions the way they would have a hundred years ago,

but does electric amplification and live audio mixing render a lot of old orchestra tech obsolete?

we simply do not require large bands to make big sound anymore

when I see modern folks on youtube chasing big band sound, they do it with much smaller groups in rooms _littered_ with sound pickups

although honestly there's still a lot of 'em, I guess there's some fullness of sound you simply can't get without a bunch of people playing it simultaneously

So, it's an open-secret that [Phnom Penh](https://phnompenhrestaurant.ca/)
has the best chicken wings in Vancouver.

so, through a weird twist of fate, I ended up with a bunch of chicken wings

and I thought “might as well give this recipe a try”

YouTube helped:

{{<youtube QMJAmM7leMg>}}

-----

{{<youtube T4d1Zavaudo>}}

My version is somewhere between these two’s takes on the famous recipe and:

I used too much seasoning on the outside: the garlic oil let too much salt, sugar, and MSG adhere to the crust making the wings a little overpoweringly seasoned.

otherwise it was DELICIOUS.

I figured this would be an insanely difficult recipe to get right because, like, if Phnom Penh is so legendary for these wings, why doesn’t every restaurant do them?

But, actually, if you do all of the steps - the long fish-saucy marinade, the thin crispy batter, the twirl in garlic butter and then sweet-salty-and-msg seasoning: it’s actually very close and very good. It’s just labor intensive, and these guys need to hit the table still very hot from the fryer.

You are in a boat.

There is a hole in the boat.

Water is rushing in.

Your three boat mates each have a plan: one of them is wearing a lifejacket and pitches that we should do nothing about the hole.

One of them does not have a lifejacket and pitches that drastic action should be taken and the hole should be patched up.

The third one, also equipped with a lifejacket, intelligently suggests a compromise: we will fix some of the hole, but not all of it.

With the hole half fixed, water continues to pour into the boat, but more slowly.

The first boat-mate argues that the hole fixing plan has failed and pitches that the hole fixing plan be dismantled and abandoned.

He is overwhelmingly popular, for reasons that elude you.

The compromise candidate defends his half-hearted hole fix.

The boat mate who proposed fixing the hole is now being fully ignored.

Next to you, a much larger boat, one without a hole, has filled up with hole-worshippers, led by something of a hole, and they have decided to unnecessarily create a hole in their boat.

As you watch them sinking, you think "perhaps the compromise half-hole guy had a good point."

Things are looking good: you might, if you're lucky, maintain your half-hearted hole plugging efforts.

In order to appease the hole worshippers, the compromise candidate promises not to touch the existing hole at all.

His plan gains a lot of steam and honestly the pro-hole party is furious. They're still very popular, though.

this might be one of my more controversial software opinions

my bar for a code review is "do I understand approximately what this code is doing and how", and that's often enough to find one or two quibbles ('hey this could have been named better" or "are you sure this part does what you think it does?") but often it leads to the ol' rubber stamp of justice

honestly I think that senior devs who can't let a single PR go by without at least one nitpick because otherwise they feel like they haven't done their duty aren't accomplishing as much as they think

sometimes I would not do things the same way that that other person did

and then I just chalk that up to "hey, everybody's mind works a different way" and go about my day

like, this is not to say I won't intervene if something truly dangerous or ill-advised is happening, but, like, once a project has been chugging along for a little while with the same people, usually it gets increasingly clear when that is the case

sometimes a PR comes in with "I'm _pretty_ sure that this won't break prod" and that one maybe deserves a little more of the fine-toothed comb

One of the things that I like to read is _medium length, well-written, informative articles_ of the sort that used to live in magazines before the information crushed them all like Blockbuster video or travel agencies.

I have a book by Ruth Reichl where she talks about her time as an editor for an important food magazine for Conde Nast in New York in the 80s and she is treated like a legitimate no-foolin' _rock star_, there are _assistants_, there are _perks_, it is wild. Magazines were _crazy_ in the 40 years ago universe that no longer exists.

But then, for a long time in my personal heyday, there was blogs, medium form articles written by amateurs, a wild and explosive flourishing of community writing projects, many of them utterly unreadable or punishingly mundane, but this was also a good time, and I subscribed to many via the use of my "A Relatively Simple Syndication" (or "ARSS" for short, because it wasn't very good) technology browser.

For a brief period, I subscribed to [Increment magazine](https://increment.com/), an expensive but lovely periodical, made entirely free online, that was - I imagine - never once for a single second profitable. This fabulous loss-leader was underwritten by Stripe, a company that makes more money in a day than I will make in my entire lifetime, so they definitely have a little bit of dosh floating around for weird vanity projects.

At least several dozen times I joked that they should have called it Excrement magazine because of _where_ I read most of the articles.

It turns out that one of my likes is just _compelling non-fiction articles_, and being as my last real subscription ended in 2021, I feel like I was one of the last holdouts on team print media.

but (_he says, patting his extremely well-laden eReader_) it's not like I'm not also part of the problem

For a while, I leaned on Pocket's featured articles in Firefox. They're _okay_. At this point I feel like I've encountered a lot of them again and again, and honestly I'm not sure if Pocket is going to keep them going now that Pocket is folding (it turns out, keeping a blog/article reading tool alive in the current internet era isn't terribly valuable, because the last human-written article was some time in 2023, apparently).

A gooseneck kettle, hario v60 and a baratza burr grinder will set you back $300.

{{< imgwebp src="melitta-2.png" >}}

I remember on a trip to San Francisco in the 10s, I was a little startled, they offered a crazy new thing called "pourover" and charged exorbitantly for it, and I, out of curiosity, paid, only to watch them make coffee

... the exact way I made coffee at home, just with more pomp.

"my mom showed me how to do that when I was just out of high school, it's actually just the best way for a person to make a single cup of coffee"

I'm a little obsessed with finding that point in the price/quality curve where you're actually getting the absolute best bang for your buck and I feel like for coffee this is it.

![isn't that basically how drip coffee makers work](./chris.png)

![blade grinder](./allen.png)

[`@apike`](https://mastodon.social/@apike) having tried burr and blade grinders, I'm gonna say it: coffee enthusiasts over-value a perfectly consistent and predictable grind

with only a little practice a blade grinder reliably produces a good cup of coffee, you just need to time it right

_although admittedly I did splurge on a nice, reasonably priced OXO burr grinder, so_

I believe that professionals tend towards techniques that produce consistency and homogeneity - like neutrally flavored broths, perfectly diced vegetables, and very precise measurements.

Amateurs who ape these techniques without having to meet the same demands are cargo culting needlessly: perfect consistency is rarely as important a goal for home cooks, so go ahead: USE a boldly flavored stock or rough chop your vegetables: it will be FINE.

The same goes for coffee grind consistency.

My thoughts on trade protectionism are actually kinda fraught?

Like, it turns out the ability of global capital to reposition itself with unlimited freedom just means that all work is done by the lowest bidder, with labor going to the country that has the fewest anti-slave-labor laws and food safety regulations on the books, right?

Trade makes us all richer _but_ protecting a local industry by pushing out gigantic international incumbents - like with dairy, or the CBC - also can be good?

China's ridiculous digital protectionism utterly sucks, but also China's software industry wasn't completely flattened by FAANG like it was in the entire western world.

Lots of local industries here are choked by practices that are so shady they almost feel like racketeering - tomato companies disappearing any stock that goes over quota so that they don't ruin the price of tomatoes as part of a vast tomato conspiracy, in order to preserve the profitability of tomato growers. Dairy prices artificially inflated so high that a basket of cheese feels like a _treasure chest_. (i mean, it _is_)

Canada is just chock-a-block with local cartels enforcing profitable little fiefdoms - with oligopolies that collude to create monopolistic behavior.

Bad for the consumer and yet when trade disaster strikes we suddenly have no oranges but a lot of tomatoes and cheese.

I think the analogy I go to for this is that off-the-grid subsistence farming where you compost your own feces is miserable,
but also living in 400 square feet downtown doing gig-work for pennies and doordashing everything you want to eat is miserable:

sane trade policy lives somewhere in the middle, so trade protectionism vs globalism both exist on a spectrum where total adherence to one or the other is going to be...  bad

Eradicating newspapers didn't exactly create utopian outcomes the way we may have hoped, but nevertheless, print media newspapers and magazines can't just keep on existing while all of their functionality lives on in a superior format.

They've been going the way of renting tapes from the local Blockbuster for a while now.

I don't feel too bad for traditional print media or the postal service, they've had more than half of my entire life to figure out some kind of viable pivot.

It's funny, when I was a kid something like the internet and e-mail existed, but it was laboriously hand-created every day, manually, by legions of hard workers doing their best to get fresh content to your door every morning and deliver all of your messages by hand to anybody who you might want to talk to.

News, movie reviews, weather updates, daily games, local updates, it was a surprisingly robust and varied offering, differentiated by the rest of written content by its relative speed and immediacy.

Obviously the speed and immediacy of electronic transmission wins, right? once your average person has access to a powerful, comfortable to use internet-enabled device at all times, the only thing a newspaper can do that a modern computer can't is act as a cheap wrapper for fish and chips.

So what do we lose? Well, business models supporting creators of hyper-local content, for one. Not a lot of vloggers out there covering the municipal news beat. Also: news had a kind of journalistic code of ethics that the internet has not been able to replace, although I sometimes think that they get lionized more than they deserve - the code was more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules.+++

So, I made a dungeons and dragons mistake.

There's some DMing advice that I adhere to pretty closely, when you're characterizing an NPC or a group of NPCs, you can kinda just file the serial numbers off of something you're already very familiar with and run with it.

I'm not that experienced with "organized crime", haven't watched anything _conteporary_
so, in our Dragon Heist campaign,
I decided that a good analogue for the Zhentarim would be "the mafia, specifically from the movie The Godfather".

{{< imgwebp src="godfather.png" alt="on this, the day of my daughter's wedding" >}}

The problem, though...

It was a _fun characterization_. It added a lot of depth and interest to the local Zhentarim.
They're not _good_, but they're _honorable_, they have a _code_. And if you're good to them?
They'll be _good, reliable allies_.

This went over entirely too well, this was the first major Waterdeep faction my players encountered, and
whoops, my players are just fully aligned with the Zhentarim now.

I mean, the players are good, there were lots of local "good" factions, but the local Zhents, with their friendly, accessible low-rent evil - well, it's just hard to say no to them. They keep making offers my players can't refuse. Players don't mind paying a little protection money or shaking up some locals now and again. A quest is a quest, even if it's to intimidate a potential witness.

Their capo, Urstul Floxin, his "friendly and helpful in a very threatening way" shtick, is actually _very_ convincing. The person who keeps talking the party into doing shady stuff is ME, actually.

{{< imgwebp src="urstul.png" alt="leave the gun, take the cannolli" >}}

I love how even in the D&D art provided by Wizard of the Coast he kinda looks like Luca Brasi.

I don't think this is really even a problem: Waterdeep Dragon Heist _is a heist story_ where the players operate a tavern, the players are naturally going to find themselves way more aligned with local organized crime than the constabulary.

**ed:** Months later, Urstul has provided the players with their own goons, Guido and Nunzio, a little dumb one and a big gentle one, and they're already productively contributing to schemes and nonsense.

So I follow the subreddit for comics - no, not that one, the one for

and what struck me as funny about this one was not that the comic _itself_ was funny, but that someone would spend hours of their day slaving over this series of images

this creator was struck by the muse, but it wasn't one of the _good_ muses, it was the "I must draw the pope twerking" muse, that's the one they got today, and I'm glad they decided to go with it anyways+++

So, uh, perhaps you are familiar with Arkham Horror? Maybe a decade ago I brought you to my home to attempt to play it as a group?

{{<imgwebp src="arkham.png">}}

<!--more-->

It's sort of a hybrid of "board game" and "RPG" where in the course of one evening, you and a handful of investigators attempt to prevent an Old One from being summoned, while being faced with a steady stream of bad luck and nasty surprises from a "Mythos Deck".

A board-game one-shot adventure, like Descent: Journeys in to the Dark, or Heroquest ([BRODESWODE!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx8sl2uC46A)).

Each player starts as a different unique investigator, with a few unique skills that make them better or worse at one of the key elements of the game.

If you strip the board game down to its grubby little bones and polish them to a mirror sheen, you end up with Pandemic, a game that came out three years later and eclipsed Arkham Horror in popularity: You and your team of investigators are mostly doing your best to contain an awful lot of nasty stuff happening around you.

Arkham Horror is a messy game, packed with obscure rules, difficult to run, filled with moments where you have to stop everything and check the manual to see if you can, for example, use a chainsaw and a motorcycle at the same time (yes, and it is awesome). Pandemic is unquestionably the more polished experience, although it loses most of the fun _theme_. (At no point in Pandemic do you ever even _need_ to check the rulebook to determine if you can use the chainsaw and motorcycle at the same time, at which point why even bother to play?)

Anyways, there have since been more than a few iterations on the original Arkham Horror formula, <small>none of which have bothered to confront or even acknowledge how much of an utter shitheel H.P. Lovecraft was, but hey, that's a lot to ask</small>.

Like Elder Sign - same game, same themes, but simplified and given to the players in a Yahtzee-like format.

{{<imgwebp src="elder_sign.png">}}

I have a copy of this sitting on my shelf and it's Quite Good, although it has been a good long time since I've brought it to the table. I _can say_ that it offers almost all of the fun and themes of Arkham Horror, but with a more satisfying gameplay loop and a more polished ruleset. The big piles of dice and simplified gameplay, though, can really lay bare how much your success or victory comes down to a single roll of the dice - like with most "more streamlined" experiences, it does sacrifice a lot of little thematic touches.

Then, there's **Eldritch Horror**, **Arkham Horror: 3rd Edition**, and **Mansions of Madness**.

Not much to say about Eldritch Horror - I haven't played it, but by and large it is regarded as a significantly cleaned up and tightened version of Arkham Horror - a spiritual successor, easier, more Pandemic, less Chainsaw/Motorcycle.

{{<imgwebp src="eldritch.png">}}

And **Mansions of Madness** really leans into the RPG aspect, dividing one player from the group to act as a sort of Dungeon Master, an antagonistic foil to the player's designs - or, in the second edition, turning over the antagonism to an _automated phone application_. Out of all of the games in the Arkham series, this one is the most like a traditional pencil & paper tabletop RPG.

So, uh, this is the Arkham series, and I'm gonna talk a little bit about some of the problems with it:

### Quarterbacking & Wasted Turns

These are some of the earliest of the _popular co-operative games_, and as such, they suffer badly from some of the worst qualities of the genre: namely, that it is quite possible, probable, even common for one player who knows what they're doing to _manage the entire table_ while a whole group of people... _watch_.

The division of responsibilities and skills also can often leave the board in a state where there's only a few players who _can_ be effective, leaving the rest of the players to just sort of _stand about_. For the players who _do_ have something useful to do, well, that thing is usually so obvious that it's not much of an interesting decision. I have definitely played whole games of Arkham Horror where I just sort of haunt the card-draw parts of the map digging around for a shotgun or a grenade or something.

### You Aren't Supposed To Win
In order for the co-op game to feel _challenging_ it has to be _challenging_ when played against a completely mindless opponent, and that challenge is driven by making the game just a little bit too hard.

Which means that, on average, especially if you're not playing _perfectly_, you're going to **lose**. You're going to lose to something random and capricious and stupid. One of your investigators is going to get emotionally wrecked by a bad experience in a gas station bathroom, causing them to go insane and become devoured.

That's... well, that's one of the reasons why the theme works so well in the first place. Lovecraftian Horror is _the right theme_ for a game where you are destined to _probably lose_. People will die, people will go insane, you'll probably fail.

### Complexity and Theme and Randomness is Fun, Until it Isn't

Arkham Horror's massive, bloated, over-complicated rule set is part of what makes it so evocative. The game itself is a thing of lovecraftian horror - too many rules, too many surprises, too _much to deal with_. It's big, and with that bigness comes a big implied promise: if you learn how to manage all of this complexity you'll have unlocked a potent story engine that generates a fun tale.

But the game's wild... bigness, is a thin disguise around a huge pile of decks and decks of random events - it doesn't always deliver on that promise.

It's quite possible to lose this game on the first turn. It's quite possible to luck into a party armed to the teeth with ancient relics and flaming swords able to topple an Old One on their own, just waiting out the game's clock.

If you're going to put this much effort into a Great Big Game, you might as well put that effort into [Scythe or Eclipse](https://marquee.click/t/twilight-imperium/490/19) and at least get some satisfying gameplay out of it.

On the other hand, attempts to strip Arkham Horror down to easier, smaller, more strategic bite-size experiences... don't really capture what made it great.

Quinns described the core gameplay of the simplified Eldritch Horror as "irredeemably boring" - the meat on those bones is all in the theme, the randomness, the _weird stuff that happens_.

Elder Sign's _gameplay_ is fun, but it barely feels attached to the theme at _all_. At some point you might as well just play Yahtzee! At least with that one you can play it with your mother-in-law without having to go through the embarassing experience of explaining what an "Elder Sign" is.

## On To The Card Game

Why do I mention all of this stuff?

Well, there's a new Arkham game in town, and it's ... quite good. Quite good indeed.

{{<imgwebp src="cards.png">}}

This is a "Living Card Game" - kind of a spiritual successor to both _Eldritch Horror_ and _Android: Netrunner_.

I really quite liked Android: Netrunner. It was a clever design for a game, wrapped in a cool theme. The idea of a LCG is that it works kind of like Magic: the Gathering - in that cards are continuously added to the game in perpetuity - but instead of randomized booster packs, the game's new cards are released in named sets, which you can collect at your own leisure.

Android: Netrunner was fun, but it had a bit of a problem: the competitive game's balance would swing wildly around as new decks game out. For people looking to run the game in their own homes, it would sort of fall on players either to agree to buy the exact same subset as other players that they want to play with, buy the entire universe and be aware of 100% of the game's current footprint at all times, or just kind of hope that they could build a balanced, competitive subset of the game out of whatever they had on hand.

So: Arkham Horror the LCG. It's out there solving Android: Netrunner problems and Arkham Horror problems.

So how does it work?

### The Basic Gameplay

Okay, in short: You and your co-op team each have individual Investigator decks. These decks are wildly distinct from one another - there's five core "classes" of card - Guardian (hit stuff), Seeker (find clues), Mystic (do weird magic), Rogue (run away from things and gain resources) and Survivor (miscellaneous special effects) - and each of the investigators has a mix of cards from two classes, a primary and secondary class.

I picked **Roland** (Guardian/Seeker), a practical monster-punchin' and clue-findin' combo for a straightforward game and Tiff picked **Agnes** (Mystic/Survivor), a big mixed-bag of weird tricks and lucky effects.

You draw 5 cards and take 5 resources, lay down a half-dozen Locations, ploop your investigator at the entrance to one of the locations, and are offered 3 actions per round, with which to perform one of 8 different actions:

* play a card,
* activate an effect on a played card
* draw a card,
* draw a resource,
* move from location to location,
* investigate a location to maybe find Clues, (which are generally required to win the game)
* fight a monster
* evade a monster

then, you take a resource, you draw a card, all of the enemies in the game get to attack you, you add a doom token to the "you lose" track, and each investigator draws a fresh Very Bad Problem from the Bad Times deck, which summons monsters and negative story events pretty much willy-nilly.

While you're doing this, you're racing your investigators ability to rack up clues (a difficult, time-consuming activity) against the game's ability to line up doom tokens in the "you lose" track.

### Skill Checks, and THE CHAOS BAG

![](./douchebag.png)

Why, it's my main man, Roland Banks.

![](./roland.png)

He's a bit of a Mario, pretty balanced across all fields, he's got some Willpower, some Intellgience, a little extra Punch It In The Face and not a lot of Run Away.

A lot of things in this game come down to Skill Checks - they come up often. Combat checks to fight monsters, Evade checks to run away from monsters, Intelligence checks to investigate and get clues, and Willpower checks to not go completely banana-pants insane.  On _average_, the difficulty level of a skill check is going to be about _3_.

So, Rollo here, with his "3-ish in every stat", should have an easy time with most checks, right?

Wrong! The CHAOS BAG is a great big bag filled with tokens, and you have to draw one every time you do a skill check.

{{<imgwebp src="chaos.png">}}

Also: **the Chaos Bag hates you**. It contains 2 good outcomes, 2 neutral outcomes, and **12** bad outcomes. If you're playing on "standard" mode, like some kind of fresh-faced noob. If you want the game to really Bring The Pain there's a variant that does away with any remaining good outcomes and throws some -6s and -8s in there for good measure.

If you don't trust that you'll be able to pass a check (especially considering the mean Chaos Bag), well, you have cards that can help in your hand.

### Campaign

The base set comes with three _missions_ that you can take your investigators on, which link to one another in a single unified campaign.

They have _stories_ (albeit pretty perfunctory ones) and their own weird mechanics, and _twists_.

These individual missions take about... 60-90 minutes for two adults to clear.

![](./campaign.png)

Each mission has its own locations, victory conditions, and even special rules.

At the end of the campaign, your investigators either **die horribly at the hands of an otherworldly horror** (this happened to us) or barely save the day and retire, forever maddened by their experience - each campaign is intended to be started by a fresh investigator deck with _no experience_.

<small>although the internet is convinced that the later campaigns are intended to be started by a fresh investigator with _no experience_ but a whole bunch of great cards and deckbuilding experience from all of the previous campaign cycles so they're apparently quite a bit harder </small>

### Deckbuilding

The core game comes with 5 pre-made decks, sufficient to throw at the game's campaign. As players attack the campaign objectives, they earn experience points, which should allow them to purchase from a handful of more expensive and powerful cards provided to upgrade these default decks.

Technically, _all of the game's decks are customizable_ - within certain parameters - but there aren't really enough cards in the base set to really change the fundamental properties of the decks provided. Why, to get your hands on more cards you'll probably need to... go buy some expansion packs.

### Expansion Packs

So, having played the mini-campaign using the pre-fab decks, you're gonna want to get your hands on _more_.

More campaigns! More cards to build decks with! More investigators!

Well, guess what? That's why Fantasy Flight Games wanted to get you in on this train in the first place.

So, what you get when you want to get rolling on a real adventure is a _cycle_.

A cycle starts with a base set:

![](./base.png)

This includes the campaign guide for the cycle, and five new investigator decks full of _delicious cards_ for you to play with.

![](./investigators.png)

Also: the first mission in the campaign.

But just the first mission, if you want the whole campaign you've gotta get your hands on the whole set, which looks more like this:

![](./set.png)

Each of these missions contains a segment of the story, a complete mission, a Whole Bunch of New Bad Things That Can Happen To Your Investigator, and a handful of new investigator cards, including upgraded cards that you can add to higher level decks.

I wonder why they would do it that way?

Oh, yes, I know why:

![](./price.png)

Crikey, FFG, what a creative way to drain bank accounts.

While this seems unbelievably nefarious, let me refer you to some of the problems with Android: Netrunner - in a _competitive_ game, the problem of "defining an interesting and fair subset of the card space so that players don't have to simply buy every card in existence" is significant (this is also why Magic: The Gathering's draft format is so popular: it solves a core problem with the game by simply having that subset defined in-situ for a single play session)

However, in this co-operative game, there's fun to be had with whatever cards you have on hand, so long as you've got at least one campaign. Heck - the core set alone has quite a lot of gameplay in it. Tiff and I have definitely made three nights of fun out of the starting campaign, and there are more investigator decks we haven't even tried yet!

While I'd prefer it if the cycles were simply boxed and sold together as, well, whole entire cycles - the system of having a couple of friends and a big common pool of cards to draw from for an ever-growing adventure is actually... pretty cool!

### My Friend, Dynamite

![](./teamdynamite.png)

This card is absolutely bonkers useful. I am **Team Dynamite** Forever. This game is not shy about absolutely mobbing you with baddies, and/or throwing monsters at you with a great many hit points while your puny fists deal an absolutely pitiful 1 damage per attack.

The dynamite is a real conversation ender, at the expense of also being a touch volatile, dangerous, and expensive.
I found an absolutely _clutch_ use for it in all three of our first missions. Dynamite is the difference between victory and failure. Hold on to that sweet Dynamite.

In fact, we'd have won all three campaign missions if I hadn't suffered a spate of truly critically bad luck. All we had to do to _not lose_ was interrupt a simple cult ritual, and as The Muscle, all I needed to do was clear the way of _several cultists_ so that Tiff could go in and use her occult knowledge to, like, _move some candles around_. Simple enough. To simplify the task of _rapidly removing a mess of cultists from play_ I also happened to be holding a stick of the aforementioned Dynamite, my favourite card.

There was just one simple thing - a rule I almost forgot to enforce it was so harmless seeming: I just had to find my way out of the dank forest that I was just hunting for clues in, which required that I pass a simple Investigate check.

Look, time was of the essence - we only had a few turns left before the cultists summoned [REDACTED] the big nasty thing that will definitely kill you - and a failed check would definitely waste time. So, to ensure that I'd have plenty of time to go clear the way for Tiff, I threw _every investigation card I had_ at the Investigate check.

I couldn't _possibly_ fail.

**The Chaos Bag Hates You**. I drew the red token, the "insta-fail, no questions asked" token. Having burned all of my investigation cards, my chances of getting out of the forest on a regular check dropped drastically, and _I spent the remainder of the game trapped in the forest while cultists and Young Deep Ones murdered Tiff_.

_whoops_.

Well I guess we all died, and it was pretty definitely my fault.

I guess the one problem they didn't solve was the _difficulty_. This horror ain't no cakewalk. At this point, though, I think long-standing fans of the series have come to expect it. It wouldn't be cosmic horror if you could _win_ reliably.

## Good Things

This game... solves a lot of the problems with Arkham Horror, and is quite good.

Quarterbacking, for example: you're playing _your own investigator_. You don't know what's in other players' hands. You don't even know what they've put in their decks. In fact - you shouldn't know. Don't even _try_ to learn that stuff. Quarterbacking is not much of a problem in Arkham Horror: TCG.

The game is pretty good about _almost always_ giving the investigators something useful to do, although admittedly it remains possible to get trapped in an ancient forest while your partner gets savaged by monsters that they are utterly unequipped to fight.

The randomness and capriciousness of Arkham Horror? Well, that's toned _way down_ because each individual campaign mission is actually pretty tightly planned and tuned. Oh, sure, it's possible to get bad draws, or good draws, and have a really bad time or a really good time with a specific campaign mission - but that falls inside a _much tighter band of possibility space_.

In a story about trying to hunt down cultists in an ancient forest, "the cop, driven insane from the things he's seen, gets lost in the mist and clawed to death by ghouls; leaving the woman he was sworn to protect to die" feels congruous with the story that we were telling with the cards. Before the "forest x cultist" mission, we were instructed to stock the encounter deck with a whole mess of cultist things and forest things, and took out a bunch of things that wouldn't have felt right coming up randomly while we were in the forest.

**I had fun**. Fun was had, by me, legendary grump.

## The Bad

There's an **absolute buttload** of rules to this game. Like - it's _seemingly_ simple but there's still quite a lot going on. There's a _pretty complete implementation of Arkham Horror_, under the hood, here, combined with all of the extra complexity of an Android: Netrunner style action/resource/card system.

We misplayed quite a few early rules to the game, accidentally making the game harder for ourselves again and again and slowly improving as we went. I know that at at least one point, I had accidentally put way too many Doom counters in play (when you kill a creature with a doom counter on it, that doom counter is supposed to be discarded, but I didn't know that).

At another time, I had accidentally three hands worth of equipment in play.

> {{<imgwebp src="3hands.png">}}
> 3 hands

And, you know what? The deckbuilding isn't really that satisfying with 5 pre-made decks and _few customization options_. Which means that in order to really, truly experience this game, gotta drop some MAD STACKS, YO.

And the campaign included in the Base Set was _short_. A lot of the mechanics that crop up in the base campaign have to do with _speeding up the accrual of doom_, speeding up an already fast campaign.

Okay, here's another concern: I'm not _entirely sure_ if I believe that the core campaign is actually practical to beat without Roland. He's the _only investigator who's got access to a shotgun_. Although... actually, that kinda makes me want to give it a try and find out.

### Anyhow

So far, it is pretty good!

Soon I'm gonna crack into some of that Dunwich cycle of extra cards and see if I change my mind....

It's a card game! It's a narrative game! It's a combination card game narrative game!

<!--more-->

It's... _okay_. A solid **B**.

[MANY SPOILERS AHEAD]

The way this works is you have a tableau of cards, representing a wide variety of things - people, objects, books, money, your own personal stats - each card is socketable in a handful of "verb" slots.


{{<imgwebp src="cards.png">}}

So, if you socket your HEALTH into the WORK slot, for example, you'll go do taxing manual labor for a day, producing a FUNDS. If you then put your FUNDS into your DREAM slot, you'll buy a bunch of opium and have fucked up dreams, which might produce a CONTENTMENT (good!) but might also produce a FASCINATION (bad!) or a DREAD (very bad!).

While all this stuff is happening, a timer ticks forward. While the timer is going, it'll do things like consume funds (you've gotta eat) and generate random nasty events.

This game is also _proud_ of its complete and utter lack of tutorial. It figures - you'll figure things out, right?

So, on my first play-through, I managed to figure out how to put card A in socket B just enough to actually figure out how to buy a few spooky books and get a cult going - but I got trapped in a dead-end job working for a stingy boss - the game hinted ("you can do something about this") but I couldn't figure out what - and I ended up dying from a sickness that I couldn't afford to cure (that's American health care for ya).

Before I got there, I managed to walk through the WAY OF THE WOOD in my dreams, to a land where I could harvest potent magical energies. Not sure what to do with potent magical energies, but they were there.

So I consulted a wiki gently.  I didn't want to spoil much, but sometimes you need to see what exactly you're up against. I did a little bit of prep and prepared myself for a second run.

On my second run, I really managed to get things up and running - the game gives you the option to play as a physician the second time around, who has a job that _isn't terrible_ and that he can't be fired from. His ability to poop out regular money leaves him insulated from sickness, so that's a step forward! I started my new cult in earnest, trying to figure out what to do with my newfound cult.

This was, uh, actually kinda hard. Advancing the main goal of the game seemed to require that I Walk Through The Stag Door (?) and also required a powerful Lore that I wasn't sure when I'd be able to get my hands on.

Most of my other goals were stymied by similarly cryptic requirements. On top of that, my periodic cravings to _do_ something with my time would produce RESTLESSNESS, which, if it sat around long enough, would decay into DREAD, feeding DESPAIR, a card that, if it could consume 3 DREAD, would end the game.

I lucked into finding a cabaret which, if I poured funds into it, would produce CONTENTMENT, which could fight off DREAD, but I needed those funds to buy books to fuel my magical awakening.

I also kept running in to FASCINATION cards, which were piling into VISIONS. I thought "that sounds good, the VISIONS might help" - I'd later learn that the VISIONS were not here to help.

While all of this was happening, a WEARY DETECTIVE showed up - great - and started to hoover up all of the loose clues about crimes that I was leaving lying about on the board, building a TENTATIVE EVIDENCE, then upgrading it to a DAMNING EVIDENCE - seemingly another game-over waiting in the wings.

Eventually, I tried to go on an expedition to a mystic location I'd found - but that expedition tied up the "EXPLORE" verb, which I needed to use to cabaret away the DREAD, and I died from DESPAIR.

So, I'd made no further progress, except to discover that by stumbling around trying things, I'd managed to turn up several interesting ways to die.

So either I'd have to suffer through a lot of [trial-and-error](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/TrialAndErrorGameplay)
OR it was time to consult
[the wiki](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/GuideDangIt)
again.

It brings to mind an iOS game I played, Doodle God, that featured gameplay of "mostly trying to rub various concepts together to see if something interesting would happen"

> {{<imgwebp src="doodlegod.png">}}
>
> Fire + Energy = Plasma

**2025 Editor's Note:** or https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/ where you can do that but the combinations never run out.

This time, I went in with a plan - a slow and steady plan. This time I'd focus all of my attention on keeping my character in a steady state. No dread, no fascination, no police attention.

And... it went well! I discovered that RESTLESSNESS can be channelled with PASSION into horrifying paintings, rather than dread. If I saved up money for the cabaret, I could fight dread as soon as it cropped up rather than having to fight it piecemeal. FASCINATION could be dreamed away with any spare DREAD, or with memories that I could drum up now and again.

The only problem was the police, hoovering up clue cards that lots of the core game actions produce. I managed to kill the WEARY DETECTIVE after sending about six different hired goons after him (also: figured out how to hire goons) - and he was promptly replaced by a _named investigator_ who was now hoovering up all of the extra clues that I'd been producing by trying to kill the original detective several times over! Hardly ideal, it seemed like I'd just multiplied my problem.

**further wiki consultation**

I guess I could try evidence tampering?

Yup, the solution to the police problem turned out not to be murder, but _evidence tampering_. None of my own cultists were leveled up far enough to be capable of that (nor were they terribly capable of murder, to be honest) and the upgrades that would get them there would take me (now that I've spent that time) another 4 hours of real play time to actually accrue.  So I hired a swindler. (Hiring people is a _random event_, like so many things in this game are, so I just had to keep on wandering around the city on loop until one turned up).

The swindler tried to tamper with the evidence. Failed. Got hurt. I paid for their medical care and sent them back to tamper with the evidence again. Failed again. Got hurt again. More medical care. On their third try, they succeeded. All three of those times they generated clues but being as clues make evidence and the evidence was something that I could clear (with effort) I was golden! I'd just need to roll the dice to find a swindler every time I needed them.

Or... did I? Here's the thing, cards only decay when they're sitting on the table, not in use. If I didn't want to lose the swindler, I could just keep them in active use forever. It'd slow down gameplay somewhat to lose that entire verb, but... well, swindling produced funds and silenced cops, so now I had an answer to all of the different "end game" conditions.

Which... allowed me to play the game properly, if carefully. For hours, with the actions required to stave off death becoming rote. Hours and hours. I used my funds to plunder local occult areas and buy all of the books in the spooky book store and _also buy out anything of interest from the auctions. I upgraded my stats all the way to their stattiest.

And that was _legitimately pretty fun_ for a couple of hours. I built an engine and solved one of the core puzzles of the gameplay: simply not dying.

![](./corpse.png)

But then... I was still stuck. The wiki indicated that I needed to try some new things, so I figured out how to get past The Way of the Wood to the White Door, and eventually the Stag's Door - which proved to be useful, unlocking further expeditions.

But... here's where the game starts to get a bit sluggish. The loop at this point is:
1. In your dreams, find a door
2. Go through the door, find a memory fragment (random, might be something else that you don't need as much)
3. Explore the memory fragment to find a location
4. Check out the location on the wiki to find out what you need to be successful at that location (failure is expensive and all you learn is "I guess it wasn't THAT combination of people")
5. Upgrade your cultists or hire goons to be able to beat the challenges at that location (this involves a LOT of luck, too)
6. Beat the location.
7. Get books.
8. Read the books.
9. In these books are Lores, which, if you get _enough of them_, might help you unlock the next door. Or not. Who knows.

You're doing these while also running all of the various wheelings and dealings you need to stay alive - and so, with my careful, grinding gameplay, several hours, and some help from the wiki I got through, I'd estimate, about the first 40% of the game's _books n' lores n' shit_.

But... past that point... the loop doesn't get much more complicated. Or much different. It's just a big ol' randomness-powered skinner box of luck and patience. That's about the part where it's time for me to bail - I've seen most of the interesting stuff the game has to offer, and now all it has for me is _grind_. The wiki more-or-less confirms that this is the case: while the steps become more difficult, random, and grindy as I go, I'm mostly just many hours and not much terribly interesting content away from an uncomplicated victory.

So, like, a _B_. The game has a _lot_ of interesting ideas - cool art design, fun writing - I doubt I'll ever bother to finish it.+++

Perhaps you, too, have watched the recent SUSD video, priced out a MPC Nisei run, thought "whoa there", and are now thinking "maybe I could just print off my own deck".

I can help! I have a handful of _hot tips_!

### First of all:

The proper way to make a nice playing card at home is a topic of much debate on the Print n' Play forums at BGG, where the process seems to involve some dark alchemy involving sandwiching a nice thick cardstock between two sheets of printed glossy paper with spray on adhesive, cutting the cards, using a special rounded corner tool to get those nice edges, and applying a card lacquer as the final step to protect and seal the cards and give them a nice glossy smoothness for good card feel.

I am _nowhere near this dedicated_. My technique is something much dumber and almost infinitely faster: thin glossy inkjet paper in an opaque card sleeve, with a playing card behind it to give it some weight and snap. This is a technique so foolproof that an idiot, a child, heck, even *I* could do it.

Printing out the full System Gateway takes 26 pages of glossy inkjet paper.

### Printing Lessons Based on Stupid Mistakes I've Actually Made:
(on this project and others)

* A lot of cardstock, if you try to print sharp colors or photo-quality images on it, you're going to end up with a muddy, washed out mess as the ink sinks into the cardstock's rich nooks and crannies where it forms itself into a grey-brownish muck. You don't want this for your cards. Nobody wants this. Glossy paper is for crisp prints. Rough cardstock is for mistakes.
* Inkjet printers either have pigment or dye based inks, and if you don't get the right kind of glossy paper for that ink, then the ink _literally will not adhere to the paper_ and that ends up looking extremely bad.
* Everything in North America is Letter, not A4. The print files are sized such that scaling should not be necessary _at all_.

If you don't have a home printer capable of spitting out the kind of glossy nice quality you want for cards, most print shops, Kinkos', or Staples-s will print 26 nice glossy color pages for you for ... about a buck a page.

I _do_ have a really nice printer, though. I managed to save $30 on print fees by spending _hundreds of dollars on a printer_. That's economics for you, baby!

### Cards and Sleeves: You Need 'Em

Once you've got your print ready, you can proceed with exactly four decks of standard playing cards: there are at least 14 cards in the set you don't need to sleeve (blanks and "welcome/good bye" cards), more if you don't want to sleeve the rules-for-draw-and-stud-netrunner - so, printing every one of the 21X unique cards would take just under 4x55 card decks (52+2 jokers+rules).

Don't buy the cheapest sleeves you can get your hands on, or clear sleeves, that's not going to be a good idea. I have some dirt-cheap sleeves I used for an earlier print-and-play project and they just feel terrible to play with.

Okay, now you have 26 pages of cards, 4 decks of playing cards, and 300 sleeves (if you buy 200 you're going to have to make some ugly decisions). All you need to do is carefully cut out all of these cards. It's time to sit with a podcast and be very patient and quiet for a couple of hours.

### Wait, Am I Actually Saving Money, Here?

If you're following the budget here at home, at $30 for the print, three packs of $10 sleeves, and four packs of dollar store ($2.50) playing cards, you're in it for $70. This is still fairly exorbitant, but we're comparing against $75+$25 S&H for MakePlayingCards, so so long as we regard our time as worthless (and boy do I ever) we're coming out slightly ahead.

## Not terribly useful lessons I've learned about cutting:

1. Machines like the Cricut or Silhouette are going to seem like a magic bullet for tasks like this, but actually they are very frustrating: their registration is always a LITTLE OFF, if their blade catches they can easily mulch an entire page (and inkjet ink isn't cheap, that's like 50 cents worth of paper they just chewed up), and ultimately setting up cut runs takes quite a bit of time.
2. A nice paper guillotine will make short work of a big card cutting project like this, although: these cards in particular are printed 9-to-a-page, giving you almost no margin for error: you _have_ to do the pages one at a time and be very, very precise about lining up your cuts. Great if you have access to a good guillotine.
3. A big cutting surface, an x-acto knife, and a metal ruler does a good job and produces very precise results.
4. Ultimately what felt most satisfying and meditative was just sitting with a pair of regular craft scissors and cutting these by hand.

Anyways, once you've cut, carded, and sleeved your deck, you're good to go.

Now on to the even more difficult stage two: attempting to convince your wife to play Netrunner with you.

**2025 editor's note**: I could not, in fact, accomplish this.

## Tokens

{{<imgwebp src="tokens.png">}}


Tom had one recommendation during this video that, actually, I thought was worth chasing a little bit.

Netrunner comes with a full set of little cardboard tokens.  So does the Arkham Horror LCG. NISEI doesn't have the Netrunner tokens, but... I still have the ol' Netrunner Core Set from 2012, I could dig that out if I wanted a full set of tokens.  I kinda _don't like cardboard tokens_. They're small and light and fussy and they don't feel satisfying to move around and play with.

On top of that, my home-printed Ascension rip-off doesn't have any tokens at all!

In some of my games, I've replaced cardboard token money with REAL METAL MONEY - after I tried Century: Spice Road with the satisfying metallic clink of its coins, I was like "huh, this is nice". Real Metal Money is _more satisfying_, but it's generally quite _expensive_.


Arkham Horror LCG calls for _5 different types of tokens_ (health, sanity, resources, clues, and doom) and getting them all out and sorta smooshing them in separate little piles (or individual bowls if I'm feeling extra) takes a bunch of set-up time and table space. **Set up time and table space are at a real premium around here!**

Netrunner, too, calls for resources, bad publicity tokens, brain damage tokens, tag tokens, and virus tokens - so - again, _5 different types of tokens_. "Brain Damage", "Tag", and "Virus" also only come in to use with _very specific deck types_ , so, like, if you're putting out the "Brain Damage" baggie there's a 95% chance it sits unused.

So, uh, NISEI, just right on the face of it, came in hard with a big solution to the token problem by giving players cards for "bad publicity" or "brain damage" or "tag" - now, you can have just one kind of token and, if it's roaming around free, it's a resource, but if it's on the runner's "brain damage" card it's a brain damage. Bins! They dramatically reduce the set of different chip types that are required. Particularly good for rare kinds of counter.

Anyways I picked up some multi-colored poker chips to use them with these card games and _whoof_. Good purchase. We played the Arkham Horror LCG and setting up the token pools was as easy as grabbing stacks of differently colored chips and plooping them on the table. The stacks were space efficient _and_ satisfying to use.

**2025 editor's note:** they're also great for Dungeons & Dragons!+++

_and why I think that's important_

{{<imgwebp src="greetings.png">}}

<!--more-->

Did you know that Sid Meier has written a book?

{{<imgwebp src="memoir.png">}}

It’s… uh, slow, and it very much is a lot more about Sid’s life than his design philosophies.

![](./trainstories.png)

A fun detail of the book is it lays out how little of the Civilization series is actually Sid’s handiwork: Every Civilization game has had a different lead designer, many of whom deserve [more attention and accolades for their work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Reynolds_(game_designer)). “Sid Meier” is more of a brand name at this point.

One funny tale in this book is how Sid sunk years of his life and absolute mountains of time into [C.P.U. Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C.P.U._Bach), a generative music program that went over like a lead balloon.


_It’s a well known fact that every single software developer, regardless of musical talent, thinks that they can crack the “interesting generative music” puzzle. I mean, [certainly not me](/videos/2020/a_terrible_concert/), but every other software developer is extremely prone to this flaw, as far as I can tell._

Anyways, this is a digression, but it leads to a point I want to make about why a totally different game that I love, Slay the Spire, is so good.

“Games are a series of interesting choices”, said Sid Meier.

It’s a design philosophy that, I think, really informs games like Civilization. Deeply enjoyable, fun games. And every (stock) game of Civilization starts with the same interesting choices: given the resources around me, do I settle here, or explore first to find a start point with better resources? If I settle, what’s the first thing I should build?

I like “settle immediately” and “build a scout”; modern Civ games usually arrange things such that your starting position is a good place to build a city by default, and the scout’s utility in the early game is massive: they usually pay for themselves dozens of time over in goodie huts and information.

We’re not talking about Civ though! We’re talking about Slay the Spire! FOCUS, CURTIS.

Slay the Spire starts out with this whale, Neow, cruising in and offering you an interesting decision up-front.

{{<imgwebp src="greetings.png">}}

Interesting trade-offs. Would you like more cards in exchange for less hit-points? Would you like a random power in exchange for a weak but known power?

The game’s interesting trade-offs continue as you go. You’ll be presented with card after card, deciding which ones to add to your deck, and that decision is painful every time. Each card is situationally useful and uses up space that could be devoted to other cards.

Slay the Spire is so good. Rock Paper Shotgun’s Alec Meer called it a [miracle of design](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-spire-review). We’re hitting the point in time when the games inspired by Slay the Spire are going to start rolling in because this game was so unique and so good that everybody who played it just wanted more, but Slay-the-Spire-inspired games often fall flat, because it is just so, so hard to keep decisions balanced on the knife-edge of interest the way that this game does.

I just want to talk about one tiny detail.

You start the game with 3 energy per turn, and a hand full of 5 cards that either do 6 damage, or block 5 damage. Your opening turns will involve playing 3 cards out of 5.

You have a few cards that aren’t 6 Damage (Strike) or 5 Damage (Defend), but we’ll pretend those aren’t part of the equation, for now.

So, if you draw nothing but Defends and Strikes, you can choose to

* Do 18 damage, block 0 damage
* Do 12 damage, block 5 damage
* Do 6 damage, block 10 damage
* Do 0 damage, block 15 damage

And the detail I wanted to point out is that all of the opening monsters in the game are tuned to make even this simplified decision a little bit hard.

The Cultist, for example, one of the handful of early monsters that you will fight in Slay the Spire. They have 48-54 HP, and will do 0 damage the first turn, then 6 damage, then 9 damage, then 12 damage, then 15 damage, and so on until you knock them out of the game.

These guys are quite probably the simplest monster in all of Slay the Spire. Their low initial threat and linear damage scaling make them a credible threat in Act 1, Act 2 and Act 3 of the game: Ignore a cultist for a few turns and whoops, they’re dangerous.

{{<imgwebp src="cultist.png">}}

Notably, they don’t do exactly 5 or 10 damage, so you have to decide: do I block more than I need to in order to take zero damage, or do I take a little bit of damage now to do as much damage as I can, to stop the cultist from getting stronger.

So now, what do you do? You can math this out somewhat: you need to hit them ~9 times to win the battle.

You can just strike-strike-strike, strike-strike-strike, strike-strike-strike. 9 times. In doing so, you take just one full hit: 6 the first time. 6 HP of damage, total. Well, if you could draw only strikes, which you can’t, because there are other things in your deck.

You can play as conservatively as possible: strike-strike-strike, strike-block-block (6 damage blocked), strike-block-block (9 damage blocked), block-block-block (12 damage blocked)… block-block-block (15 damage blocked), oh, shit, he’s doing more damage that I can block every turn and it’s only going up… uh, shit, strike-block-block (10 damage blocked, 8 damage), strike-strike-strike, and we win, having taken 8 HP of damage.

Even with perfect draw, which you don’t have, you are going to have to be okay with taking some damage to get through this battle: there is no perfect play, only tradeoffs.

**None of Slay the Spire’s opening monsters deal 5 or 10 damage, because that would allow you to fully block them. It would seem like an obvious decision. And obvious decisions aren’t interesting.**

 This opening puzzle is already a little bit interesting. The game quickly adds other cards into the mix, complicating the puzzle further. Perhaps you would like to spend 2 of your energy on a Bash? It does 8 damage - that’s less than the 12 damage you would get out of two Strikes - but for the remainder of this turn and next turn all of your remaining strikes will do 9 damage instead of 6. Or a Zap - shell out for a Zap and it’ll do 3 damage per turn for the remainder of the fight.

Interesting, right? I think it is.

I honestly have no idea how it’s possible to design and balance a game like this, although the Slay the Spire team reveal that a lot of it has been powered by gathering a mountain of data about every single person’s playthroughs of Slay the Spire and using it to pull, prod, and tweak the values for every single card.

let's watch an episode of Columbo

{{<imgwebp src="mdm.png">}}

<!--more-->

ugh, dream sequence, gross
![](./ds.png)

did columbo predict the "chess master cheats with a vibrating buttplug" plot 30 years before it actually happened?

this image suggests "yes"

![](./butt.png)

collars were thicker in the 70s

![](./thick.png)

oh boy, this guy HAS to be the one who's getting murdered, he's basically just a big cuddly teddy bear

![](./teddy.png)

you know what, I'm gonna say it: chess has gotten worse since the 70s, half of these pieces aren't even in use anymore

![](./chess.png)

Columbo specced all of his points into PERCEPTION and INTELLIGENCE and CHARISMA, but didn't leave a lot of space for WISDOM, so he has just harangued his vet to identify a mysterious sound that his veterinarian helpfully informs him is "snoring dog"

![](./dog.png)

Hearkening back to a simpler time when you could indicate that a character was pre-meditating a murder by simply superimposing footage of the murder method over their face: seems like our friendly ol' grandmaster is gonna get stuffed down a garbage chute.

![](./murder.png)

"You say you want me to meet you? Right next to the garbage chute on the roof? You want me to look waaaaaay into the chute? Come alone, you say? That sounds reasonable, I'll be there in five."

![](./gullible-2.png)
![](./gullible.png)

I know he didn't come to this chess event with murder on his mind but he's still just got cotton crime doin' gloves in his luggage for just such an occasion

if he doesn't wear these for chess later I'm going to have some real follow-up questions about why he travels with these

(a lot of Columbo episodes feature villains who remember to bring crime gloves: the number one way to commit an unsolvable crime)

![](./crimegloves.png)

could you... could you dolly the camera back just a scodge? this... this shot... it's... it's too close to his face. I'm uncomfortable. He's uncomfortable. Nobody wants this.

![](./whoa.png)

"Please - my girlfriend, she's very Russian, I need your help writing her a letter. You need to write, in your handwriting, 'I'm very sorry, I didn't want to have to do this', on this piece of paper. For my girlfriend. In Russian."

"Huh. Seems legit. I'm definitely going to do that."

![](./alibi.png)


He DOESN'T wear his crime gloves for chess. Why did he pack crime gloves then? I know *I* don't usually travel with a set of cotton schemin' gloves for fingerprint free murders.

wait, should I start packing those?

![](./nogloves.png)

"I'm Detective Smug Badcop, and it's my professional opinion that your professional chess player left a note, bailed on the big chess match, and while he was in the midst of escaping, fell into a trash chute and got compacted"

![](./suicide.png)

![](./disliked.png)

So this guy shows up at the scene of the crime and puts on a big show about how **sad he is that the match didn't happen** and I am not sure if I have ever seen more of a "well obviously this guy did it" face on ol' Lieutenant Columbo

![](./obviously.png)

I'm really getting in to this, this show rocks

"Oh, the fall didn't kill him? How.... very... fortunate. I need to go, uh, right now, for unrelated reasons. Could you tell me where the massive fatal glucose shots are btw?"

_We are over half way into the run time of this thing and this murderer still hasn't sealed the deal, no wonder he's so bad at chess_

![](./glucose.png)

🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺🎺

"Excuse me, sir!"

this is the most Columbo shot of the entire episode so far

![](./sir.png)


Wuh oh, the gloves are out, that means it's time to do some more crime

![](./morecrime.png)

DANGER: DO NOT SWAP DRUGS AROUND, MAY KILL CHARMING OLD CHESS MEN

![](./drugs.png)

we finally have a confirmed kill, almost a full hour in

Don't die on me! Your head's been wrapped in protective gauze for diabetes reasons!

![](./dead.png)

so, you very clearly wrote the requisition for murder drugs in the same pen that he used to write the fake "i'm leaving" note and also it's that pen you have in your hands right now

also, you didn't hear the trash compactor not murder him because your hearing aid was broken

also, you secretly met and lost to him at chess the night before the murder

also, you were cheating with anal beads

Beth, I know you're dating an attorney from the family practice - we both know that you're fabulously wealthy and a real Horseface McGoo - the only reason anybody would ever be attracted to you is to get a crack at that sweet family money pinata. So I've sent him a letter telling him that if he doesn't break up with you, I'm going to fire him.

I'm certain this will work because this is the year 1972 and "wrongful termination lawsuits", "newspapers" and "twitter" all do not exist yet.

You know what, Beth? This one's on the house, he sucks. Murder away.

"Bang, zoom! You've done it again, Ed!"

![](./security.png)

just getting ready for bed with my night pills and night gun and big glass of water

![](./nightgun.png)

Tame by today's standards, but in 1972 showing a woman this nude on television could get your show taken off the air. Such was the cultural clout of Columbo that they could get away with it

![](./nudity.png)

You know what? I'm going to say it. This woman is the laziest damn murderer I've ever seen.

![](./lazy.png)

I guess this is extremely accurate to how I would expect a child brought up very rich would plan a murder: just get some chocolate and a gun, hop into bed, and see where the evening takes you. If nobody is murdered by the morning? Take a break for a while, you've earned it.

In order to let us know that what's coming next is a dream sequence we get the blurry edges and harp arpeggios. It's how we learn her plot: She imagines her dick brother is going to come home in the dark, unable to unlock the front door (she's stolen his key and mustarded up the lightbulb), trigger the alarm, and she's going to shoot him. "Oh, I thought it was a burglar, here to do unspeakable things to me."

However, they'd have no reason to show this as a dream sequence if it HAPPENED: what's the chance she accidentally shoots her beau instead?

![](./dream.png)

"Would you believe it? The front door lightbulb was all mustarded up and I lost my key. So I had to use my spare key, which I obviously have access to because I'm not a complete idiot."

I'm not going to lie, this has been one of the more ill-conceived murder plots on this show so far.

Columbo writers: not a tonne of respect for women.

![](./jerk.png)

What do you do when your carefully planned alibi doesn't work out?

Obviously you just YOLO-murder the guy anyways: why waste a perfectly good murder plot just because it was terrible?

![](./backup.png)

Yeah, buddy, someone mustarded up this light bulb, but good - real spicy English mustard, too, expensive stuff.

I don't know why this was so funny, but it absolutely was.

"Now my son is dead. He was my special little guy."

That's like the kind of picture Tom Haverford would have of himself.

"Ma'am, your son - he never married, did he?"

"No, he was too busy with work to think of such things. He did have a curious number of male business roommates, though. And that... burly fellow he spent all of those years with, his... roommate. Yes."

So, uh... long story. Looooong story.

Around the end of life of Cube Drone The Comic, 'round 2016, I started to experience a _lot of frustration_ that the
{{< sidenote Django Website >}}
I ... honestly wish I had a screenshot of that site, I have no recollection what it looked like.
{{< /sidenote >}}
 I'd built for Cube Drone just performed like absolute poop sandwiches on mobile devices.


"Mobile devices? Everyone's dominant form of media consumption for the past decade?" Yes, those mobile devices.

## CardChapter

So, I started working on CardChapter, a tool I would use to build newer, better, smarter comics.

I had this idea across a series of notebooks, this idea that all content would have to fit on these mobile-phone sized cards and you could jump from card to card, and each card could have its own effects, and the _story didn't even have to be constrained by horizontal space, the cards and the story could exist vertically and horizontally at the same time_ whooaaah.

At the time, I recognized that it was one of my two _ur-projects_. The projects I keep going back to, again and again, forever.

These two things are:

* **a multiplayer grid/card engine server** that could be used to power Civ-like games
* **a CMS for Comics** that could be used to host a large collection of comics.

For each of these projects, I have dozens of Git *and SVN* projects at various points in my career indicating a greenfield update to my opinions as to how to build it properly, and I’ve put these experiments to the test in live projects that I’ve pointed at the internet and actively used.

Anyways, even at that time I had _built a comics website many, many times over_. [CardChapter](https://old.cardchapter.com/#root) was a particularly weird version of the idea.

Technically, this wasn't even the first version of CardChapter: I'd already tried to build this thing a few times and failed miserably each time. It's kind of complicated to build, actually!

![](./cardchapter-1.png)

It worked - more or less - on mobile devices, although I struggled to crack some of the fuzzier issues. I never managed to get the animated scroll to a place where I was comfortable with it.

Documents were _tree shaped_. I thought that was a clever design but most people found that _confusing and weird_.

Documents used a Tiddly-Wiki style "save this document to create a new version of the document" system to propagate themselves. I thought _that_ was a clever design but most people found that _confusing and weird_.

Each document contained 100% of the entire _document_ at any given time, so as the site they described got _larger_, the page size started to climb into the megabytes: nobody _really_ wants to hit a 10MB webpage: so I implemented lazy loading on images.

It came with a neat inline editor, but the editor never supported vim keybindings, and if I jammed my fingers on Ctrl-S it would just do _something I didn't want_.

I used it to build "northwestica", a comic where I worked with some RPG players/writers to build a veeeery slow interactive RPG. Technically northwestica is longer and contains more art (and effort) than Cube Drone! But, uh, the audience never went over, like, 10 people, and it was a _lot of work_.

Also: actually building a project in CardChapter really revealed some of the seams in its design: the weird little blip on every page turn makes my eyes hurt.

> re-reading this it is pretty funny at times
>
> ![](./northwestica.png)

Okay, so, that's enough of that for a while.

Time to bounce to Ur-Project 1: Cards, Grids, and Simulation for a handful of years.

Okay, so, I burned out hard on my weird little card engine. It was fun but ultimately broken.

One of the fun little things I built in the card engine?

An animated text-o-mo-bob.

![](./sassy.png)

CardChapter used a kit text animator, but for this project I just built my own in React.

## What About WASM?

What about WASM? I mean, I'm obsessed with The Web, but can interesting experiences be delivered on The Web using full-on game engines?

So then I went down a Godot
rabbit hole for a while, and then after that I got way in to Ren'Py for a bit
and I made a whole little Visual Novel in Ren'Py which _sucked_.

For both Godot and Ren'Py, they felt much more powerful and expressive than dumb ol' JavaScript.

Also in **both the cases of Godot and Ren'Py**, after investing 50+ hours into the platform, I discovered that their WASM builds were **completely unusable**.

By and large, memory management in WASM remains an unsolved problem: game engines are generally designed to operate in a much less constrained memory environment and have a real tendency to overflow browser memory, _particularly_ on mobile devices where the browser's available headroom is wildly constricted by platforms that _don't want free web software competing with their app stores_.

So most people only ever saw the first chapter or two of my Ren'Py game, which is probably for the better.
It's still available online [here](http://comics.cube-drone.com/capilano/index.html), although for the aforementioned reasons I recommend
downloading it before you play it.

## Okay, So, What If I Wanted To Write a VN For The _Web_?

So, that's just CardChapter but... better, right?

I even built a "Text Dialogue" card into the [original CardChapter](https://old.cardchapter.com/#rpg-dialogue):

![](./jenganaut.png)

So let's start taking apart CardChapter and building it better, smarter, for the _future_.

Which takes us to...

https://cardchapter.com/s/cube-drone/atoms-isn-t-real/#intro

CardChapter 2.

I think it's like... the sixth or seventh crack at this darn software? Practically it's CardChapter 2
because this is the second one to hit an even-remotely-shippable state.

----

## How Is It Better?

Well, first of all, it abandons the button-based paging system for _free scrolling_, which works significantly better.

### Better Paging

I fiddled SO HARD with drags, and animations, and throws, tuning weight parameters, to try to get the card deck motion to feel right... only to eventually come to the conclusion that there's no draggable toolset in existence that feels as natural as _regular-ass goddamned scrolling_. I threw out all of the experiments and put the content in a _scrollbar_. It works _better_.

One of the reasons Cardchapter Original had such a complicated paging system was that it made it possible to trigger _special effects_ when you hit a specific page, like starting an animation: but in this new version we do that by using visibility triggers to determine which slide is "live".  This is - actually much MORE complicated, but it works reasonably well.

> ![](./pika.png)

### No Tree Shaped Documents
The complicated tree-based document thing? That's dead. Now there's a _single row of content_.  It's conceptually much easier to deal with.

I thought "tree-shaped documents" were clever, a neat idea, but I don't know if I ever actually found much use for them.

### Maybe Slightly Faster (In Some Conditions)?

To be honest this one's kind of a wash.

CardChapter Original Recipe was statically hosted, which is fast as hell, but all of its code lived within the single document - which introduced Cache Staleness Issues and made the document a little bigger than I'd like (~1.5MB total for most Cardchapter documents). As a result, most of the document's load time was packed into that one document downloading, which took about 300-600ms.

CardChapter New is a little Rust server which responds to queries in a matter of single-digit milliseconds, and the site's built using tightly packed [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) so the size of the compiled JS is _way smaller_

_but_...  the JS calls back to the Rust server to load cards dynamically as you scroll around on the page (and _unload_ them dynamically as you scroll away from them)

Now, with this model in mind I was able to create some absolutely monstrous 10,000 page test documents that were still performant, but that back-and-forth between the JS and the server costs some time that I didn't have to spend on the original chonker.

Ultimately the new site is just marginally faster. Also: since it's not loading everything as a single page, I can style the HTML before the JS arrives and loads, saving me a bit of "blank page" in favor of a proper load screen.

What actually helps the new site in the performance numbers is applying some throttling to the problem: that 1.5 MB download actually really sucks on a slow phone connection (which I discovered in the wild no small number of times)

> on "regular 3G" the page takes 15000 ms to load
>
> which is bad
>
> ![](./regular-3g.png)

comparatively, on the slow connection the new site loads... very quickly:

> 675ms seems svelte in comparison
>
> ![](./regular-3g-2.png)

score one for the compressed payload!

----

### Updated Animation Engine

I just finished this bit today, but the animation engine uses a more powerful variant of the Animation DSL I wrote for the card game:

![](./animation_xml.png)

{{< video src="text_animation.mp4" >}}

XML: actually the right language for controlling animated text.

---
### Content Format

Oh, boy, I spent some TIME IN THE WEEDS determining how this content was actually going to get stored.

Most of that multiple-months of weeds time was spent "learning Rust", so it wan't a major loss, but an earlier version of this had a full on internal database and account management system _with invite codes_ so that I could invite _other people_ to _also_ author content using CardChapter, and I would have had to build a whole _authoring interface_ and... and...

---
### It's Time To Admit That This Product Has a Target Market of Just Me

Okay, what if instead the server just _loads all of the content from disk_, like a statically hosted website, and I edit it... with a text editor, and save it... in version control. Like I do with _everything_.

![](./contentyml.png)

well, gosh, that makes things easier

![](./contentyml-2.png)

---
### Stuff That's Hard to Do With Static Hosting
Notice that CardChapter sets the social headers correctly, so that when I paste a link, you get a little image, and a favicon, and a title, and a description:

https://cardchapter.com/s/example/example

That's not _too_ magical but it was basically impossible to do with CardChapter's bullshit "the file contains itself" nonsense.

---

### Pipeline

Site updates are just "push to github, wait a minute". Ez. It's powered by a darned [systemd cron job](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers).

---
### WebP

uh, it automatically transcodes any images it's using from .png, .jpg, or .gif into the more compressed [webp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) format?

also it can thumbnailify and slightly modify images, because why not:

`owen.png?color=red`

![](./redowen.png)

`owen.png?color=pink&height=200&blur=1&flip_turnwise`

![](./pinkowen.png)

not sure if this is useful but it's definitely _a capability_

---
### Anyways:

Atoms Isn't Real is intended to be _real content_, if disingenuous.

But if you want to really stare into the eyes of insanity, "Example" is the test deck, used to poke and prod the various available features:

https://cardchapter.com/s/example/example

![](./bees_owen.png)

Tiff has walked into the office with me just staring at Owen Wilson, dozens of times now. It doesn't even faze her anymore. "At least you're through your `florb` phase."


----

### Wow, That Seems Like a Cool Tool for Building Out Comics, Do You Have Art That You Intend To Actually Make With It?

![](./no.webp)

I made a little presentation called "Command Line Interface" with it.

title = 'The Best Episode of Unraveled, As Determined By Science'

{{< imgavif src="unraveled-1.png" alt="BDG" >}}

_I watched all 29 episodes of Unraveled so that I can tell you, scientifically, which episode of Unraveled is the best episode of Unraveled._

<!--more-->

Now, the ideal way to deliver this content would be while wearing a fashionable suit, in front of a large pinboard of some kind, but this won't work for me. Unfortunately, both my body and camera equipment are terrible, and I do not own a fashionable suit.

Unraveled, if you are not already familiar with it, is a [now-defunct Polygon series, on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-25c8Rsobw&list=PLaDrN74SfdT7Ueqtwn_bXo1MuSWT0ji2w&index=1), where, along with his helpful team, video producer Brian David Gilbert tackles a difficult, obscure video-game-adjacent topic, like "reading every single Halo novel and telling you about them" or "actively losing his mind over obscure details in the Sonic lore".

![](./unraveled-2.png)

There are 29 episodes of Unraveled, produced between the first episode on September 2018 and the last, two years later, on December 2020, at an approximate pace of one episode per month. I also have approximately one episode per month, although with therapy I might be able to get that number slightly down.

The first step in taking these 29 episodes and determining which one most closely fits the platonic ideal of an episode of Unraveled is creating a rubric which we can use to evaluate each episode.

We can start by identifying what really makes an episode of Unraveled so good:

## Authoritativeness
In order for the humor to land properly, it's important that whatever incredibly obscure topic the piece is covering is treated with the utmost gravitas. You don't just want to know which Pokemon is the most edible - you want that information from a source that seems authoritative. You want the _final word_ on Pokemon edibility.

Otherwise the topic could come off as frivolous, and we don't want that.

## A Topic of Interest Connected to a Popular Game or Franchise

The episodes are, of course, self contained and humorous enough that you'd enjoy them whatever the topic, but the reason you clicked on the episode in the first place was very basic and animal. It promised you Mega Man lore. You like Mega Man. I can say with some fairly concrete certainty that you like Mega Man because he fights a colorful rotating cast of fancifully themed opponents, and has an arm that's also a gun - it goes "pew pew".

![](./unraveled-3.png)

## Subtly Flawed Methodology

Now that the problem space has been introduced, the next step is to concoct a plan to attack that problem space - a rubric with which to evaluate the data.

Now, considering the difficulty and relative intractability of some of the projects taken on, it's likely that no truly satisfying methodology could exist. That must be pushed aside in favor of something that's possible for a human to do, and satisfying enough.

However, this is a comedy show, not a dry lecture series, so the methodology must be in-and-of-itself entertaining.

## Foreshadowing and Call-Back

One crucial element of humor is that it is always in conversation with itself. One classic standby of comedic writing is the callback joke. There's a set-up, and then the set-up is left hanging for a bit, ideally just long enough for you to forget it - only for it to be invoked again. Callback jokes can be re-invoked again and again, but they're at their best when they give you enough time between the set-up and pay-off that you're caught by surprise.

The subtly flawed methodology itself is a form of foreshadowing: if you can catch what the problem is with the rubric, you'll be able to see the thread that, when pulled, will tease apart the whole plan.

## Act 1: The Set-Up

Together, Respectability, Topic/Franchise, Methodology, and Foreshadowing constitute Act 1 - the Set-up.

We've established that Brian is an expert, what he plans to do - and how. With that out of the way, all he needs to do is execute the plan, and we're set.

## Act 2: The Execution

This is the part where the rubber meets the road. The meat of the episode: the reason we came here in the first place. Exhaustive data. Conspiracy boards. We've established the silly premise and the absurd lengths that BDG will go to fulfil that premise, and so we're off to the races - and the more absurd the lengths are, the better the joke works.

This operates under the same logic as a virtuoso performance: it's impressive to watch someone who's mastered a difficult topic, but in this case it's a virtuoso performance of Brian suffering under an avalanche of trivial data.

## Act 3: The Twist

There comes a point in every Unraveled where the combination of data, flawed methodology, and meticulous execuction are starting to lean in the direction of an unorthodox or unsatisfying conclusion. Things started so well, but they're going off the rails quickly - what was promised was that a complex topic would be unraveled but what's quickly becoming clear is that it is the episode itself coming unraveled.

This is the twist, the turning point from which there is no return.

## Finally, the Prestige

When all is lost, though, one final beat: victory is snatched from the jaws of defeat. Perhaps from an unexpected source.

This is a great time for a callback to whatever we were foreshadowing, earlier, if possible.

---
So these are our categories:

* Authoritativeness
* Topic Accessibility
* Methodology
* Foreshadowing/Callback
* Execution & Suffering
* Twist
* Recovery

So, in order to evaluate the Unraveled episodes, we simply need to take each of these qualities, and evaluate them on a scale from one to five stars. The best episodes will be the ones that score the highest.

Actually, just before we begin, let's add one more category to the rubric:

## Does Brian Sing? How Much?

BDG has got _real theater kid energy_, and that expresses itself _constantly, through song_. Who am I to deny this part of his persona?

# Let's Begin:

* Methodology: 3

* Execution & Suffering: 3

* **Total: 23**

A solid opening salvo, this one is the boring Mario of episodes, establishing the format and tone while not taking any big risks.

![](./unraveled-4.png)
![](./unraveled-5.png)
![](./unraveled-6.png)

As the timeline dissolves into complete incoherence, the lights turn redder and redder.

The episode consistently foreshadows the mysterious details of the Time Break with the Twist being - well, the basic joke: this is getting ridiculous, and it _doesn't seem like it's going to be possible to reconcile all of the different timelines and the Time Break_ near the end.

The recovery?

* **Total: 19**

![](./unraveled-9.png)

This one's played completely straight. Brian establishes a valid methodology, doesn't get silly with it, and just _executes the methodology as planned_.

After establishing in the first episode that "unraveled" isn't just about unraveling a deep or difficult lore, it's also about unravelling _Brian_, this episode is just a straightforward lore deep-dive with no complications. Huh.

## Ranking all 200+ Mega Man robots

![](./unraveled-10.png)

* Methodology: 4
* Foreshadowing/Callback: 0
* Execution & Suffering: 4
* Twist: 1
* Recovery: 0
* Does Brian Sing: 0
* **Total: 20**

Similar to the last one: Brian just identifies a topic and goes and makes a big old graph with it. It's funny because the _graph is big_ and _this seems like a lot of work_, but this Unraveled stays extremely well-raveled.

This one might be my _actual favorite episode_ because I am a basic bitch and I just love me some Mega Man robots.

## I wasted 3 weeks of my life finding Castlevania's hottest monster

* Authoritativeness: 4

* Methodology: 3
* Foreshadowing/Callback: 0
* Execution & Suffering: 3
* Twist: 0
* Recovery: 0
* Does Brian Sing: 0
* **Total: 15**

I'm deducting some points from this one because it's pretty horny and it's methodology feels even more entirely subjective. Good methodology moments include "cutting animals and humans out of the list", but as we get further into the video the cuts include anything that would make the answer _too obvious_, which is a sign that the topic wasn't very interesting in the first place.

The suffering in this one is palpable, but it's referenced in a lost original cut of this episode which was apparently _very comprehensive_ but also _very boring_.

Losing some authoritativeness, here, too, because the cravate is clearly intended to bridge the gap between "professional" and "lothario" and its success in that space is limited at best.

![](./unraveled-11.png)

## Smash Bros. owes millions of dollars in OSHA violations

* Authoritativeness: 5

* Methodology: 4
* Foreshadowing/Callback: 0
* Execution & Suffering: 4
* Twist: 1
* Recovery: 0
* Does Brian Sing: 0
* **Total: 16**

This one suffers from the obvious problem: workplace safety, while it's everyone's job, is actually still very boring.

I'm going to give this one point of twist because it's all revealed, at the end, to be a scheme to hit up Sakurai for $50.

## Scientifically calculating the game of the year

* Authoritativeness: 4

* **Total: 22**

Unfortunately, BDG's weak understanding of math hurts his bonafides when he's trying to build a formula, here.

Fortunately, that does constitute a twist: all of the effort that he spends building a formula ends up producing just _terrible results_ - results that make his GOTY simply the game with the most Google hits. If you are following the math as he develops it you can probably suss out that _this isn't going to end well_.

> "Maybe I shouldn't have made my mom's knowledge of the game an exponential factor."

This one also features a recovery: Fortnite may not be a satisfying GOTY, so the actual GOTY is _whatever your GOTY is_.

## Every Sonic game is blasphemous

* Methodology: 1
* Foreshadowing/Callback: 3
* Execution & Suffering: 3
* Twist: 5
* Recovery: 2

A truly well-balanced episode - although plagued by weak accessibility and methodology, this one has a stronger showing in the arc and callback elements.

Attempting to understand Kingdom Hearts through Joseph Campbell's "Hero's Journey" is as clever as it is cursed. There's a moment of foreshadowing the first time that Brian goes through the loop where he "accidentally" lets slip how needlessly complicated and ornate Kingdom Heart's backstory is, as a joke.

And wow, painless. A nice loop, Kingdom Hearts through the viewpoint of the monomyth. But then, the twist: as we start stacking more and more Kingdom Hearts games on top of the chart the chart gets more and more crazy and needlessly complicated, eventually necessitating a long string connecting the hero's journey to a whole NEW hero's journey loop, "the villain's tridecagon", which he had hidden behind a sheet.

## Bowser's military hierarchy

It's just kinda Castlevania's Sexiest Creatures again, with the same flaws: it feels arbitrary and the topic is pretty unsatisfying.

This one has a small twist: at the end we use Brian's newfound knowledge of the Geneva convention to accuse Mario of war crimes! Which is... I don't know, who cares?

On the other hand, a full 5 points in the Does Brian Sing category for "We Are the Toads", a full "We Are the World" parody trying to draw attention to the plight of Bowser's poor military.

## Which Dark Souls boss is the best manager?

I'm giving this one a 0 for Accessibility because I don't know what a "Dark Souls" is and I refuse to learn.  This episode also attempts to analogize management style with "how fun it is to play against the monster in Dark Souls".

IDK, it's all over the place. Unclear! Muddy! Everybody just liked Dark Souls too much to go high-concept with this episode and instead they just kinda did free-form comedy about how each boss in the game would perform in an office situation.

The perfect E3 press conference is a relatively low-accessibility topic: an inside joke between gaming press and in-the-know gamers.

If what you're looking for is set-up and callback jokes, this episode is an exemplar: both for its constant set-ups and callbacks within the episode and the much larger set-up and callback that is "setting up the final episode of the show".

There are some serious methodological weaknesses here and Brian spending most of the episode _not in a suit_ and _cooking very badly_ hurts his authoritativeness. The "in one day" makes it essentially impossible to do well.

Most of the food comes out sad and unappetizing.

![](./unraveled-12.png)

It does rank highly for accessibility and suffering, though: I really _want_ to see someone attempt all of these recipes, and Brian suffers mightily to try and provide this for us.

Good cooking content is hard. Do you know who could have done this topic justice? Joshua Weissman, and these "cooking everything in a category" videos look like they take _weeks_ of effort.

{{< youtube 89jQLjCoWig >}}

Ultimately, this episode is _entertaining_, but it's hardly an exemplar of the Unraveled format.

After spending the entire episode foreshadowing it, Brian's attempt to create the perfect music genre for the Fallout franchise ends up just... being Ska, Brian is just describing Ska, it's been Ska the whole time.

I'm mad that this video did so well in my rubric. Maybe I shouldn't have given so many points to "Does Brian Sing".

Dividing the many, many Fire Emblem characters into archetypes? Good methodology, fun execution.

This has the strongest Recovery of any episode so far. Brian's methodology is _entertaining_ but it _utterly fails_. This episode has an arc! Brian learns a valuable life lesson! He _doesn't sing at all_, though, so the episode is trash.

Imagine if you were to take " Every Sonic game is blasphemous" and do it much, much better. This episode is _rich_ in foreshadowing as Brian gradually unveils his Waluigi similarities while building towards a dramatic moment where he realizes that _he has been Luigi the whole time_ - and the episode constitutes a long-running meta-series lore joke as _that mustache was a lot of work_. Was this part of the plan since before the start of Season 2?

High off of the arc of Waluigi, Unraveled, we have Kirby, where Brian is forced to go on a similar journey of the soul while faced with the impossibility of _figuring out what the deal is with Kirby_. This episode has some top tier unraveling in it.

Ultimately, though, the episode ends with Brian defeated. The [aporia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aporia) ending, with the unsatisfying conclusion that Kirby's many paradoxes make him impossible, unknowable.

Once again, Brian's interaction with a professional robs him of authoritativeness, and once again, Brian's weak math bonafides hurt the episode's credibility and methodology.

The twist is that Brian screws up his math and some of his major assumptions and convinces himself that it's impossible for himself or Mario to ever retire. It's funny,  but it's bad financial advice. My wife watched this and it just fed her increasing fear that it would be impossible for her, a millenial, to _ever retire_.

The Valorant tie-in reduces the accessibility and authoritativeness pretty badly here: I don't care about Valorant. NOBODY cares about Valorant. It's got interviews, the methodology is weak, the execution is awkward, and the twist is simply how _weird_ BDG manages to get with his gamer space.

Oh boy, this is a strong episode, partially because the sheer sisyphean difficulty of the task that Brian took on here was just _bananas_. The episode has some arc, some callback jokes, a little bit of everything.

After some of the weakest and _strongest_ episodes of the series, we come to this, the final episode of the series. It's a straightforward lore dive, like the ones that kicked off the series. A return to form - but with more of an arc, more emotional weight, than the previous lore dives. It's a fine way to send off the series, and it was foreshadowed as far back as "How to make a perfect E3 press conference (or drinking game)".

## Our Victors!

With that, we can crown our champion!

![](./unraveled-13.png)

"**Waluigi, Unraveled**" is the best episode of Unraveled, narrowly beating "I used The Sims to perfect my apartment" and "I read every Halo novel and became the Master Chief of loneliness".

The worst episode is, unsurprisingly, **"We created the sport of the future"**.

### Problems
Is it really **Waluigi, Unraveled**, though? I'll admit, my rubric wasn't perfect. I didn't capture literally _every single thing_ that I like about Unraveled episodes in my rubric.

Like, for example, I like it when Pat shows up. I like it when Brian does _high kicks_. It's possible I've let my own bias colour these results far too much: there's no way that you're going to accept my own, personal ranking as the _one truth_.

I'm afraid that after going to all of this trouble I've ... I've wasted my time. Your time. Everyone's time.

There is no perfect Unraveled, obviously, so ultimately this is going to be a subjective endeavor.

Well, that's disappointing. Well then. Thanks for ... reading, everyone.

# There Is No Perfect Unraveled

Huh.

You know what? There's one episode I didn't include.

A rare Unraveled, a live performance at PAX in 2019.

## The Perfect PokéRap

This... this is promising. It has "perfect" right there in the name.

{{< youtube 2cT6ULpScZA >}}

Let's look at this one.

## Authoritativeness

Nothing projects more authority than speaking in front of an audience. Brian isn't just authoritative, he's commanding.

So that's an easy **5/5**.

## Topic Accessibility

Not only is Pokémon the third most popular video game franchise of all time, _I really want to hear Brian work on the PokéRap.  This is compelling!

Okay, another **5/5**.

## Methodology

With more time than usual to develop his methodology, Brian can spend the entire first 20 minutes of his presentation laying out the methodology underlying his _perfect PokéRap_. It's detailed. It's informative. It's precise. And, of course, just at the very end, it turns out to be subtly flawed because executing his perfect PokéRap would take longer than the amount of time remaining in his presentation block.

Well, that's a **5/5**.

## Foreshadowing/Callback

Brian manages to maintain a _number_ of running jokes throughout this presentation, including "Kevin Punt", "Terry", "Audience Participation", and, of course, the set-up and delivery of the PokéRap itself. In fact, the "Audience Participation" turns out to be key to the eventual recovery.

That's a **5/5**, too.

## Execution/Suffering

The Abridged Perfect PokéRap is, indeed, a virtuoso performance: at over 9 minutes long, it still manages to include over 400 Pokemon. While I might be over-estimating the difficulty of preparing and memorizing such a thing because I am _not musical_, I think that everyone found this impressive.

Another **5/5**.

## Twist

Obviously Brian got carried away with his plans for the True Perfect PokéRap, which became downright fanciful, and just as obviously it was going to be impossible to perform, bringing him to an end-of-Act-2 darkest before the dawn moment. This Unraveled _unraveled_ and needed to be glued back together.

**5/5**.

## Recovery
But there's rescue from an unlikely source. A callback: __Audience Participation__. And this is a clever solution, too: Brian's Abridged Perfect PokéRap _does_ - sort of - contain every single Pokémon.

## Does Brian Sing

You're goddamn right he does.

**5/5**.

So there we have it. We've done it - we've found - not just the greatest episode of Unraveled: A **perfect** episode. We've done it. Science has done it.

there's only one way to celebrate

My dad is looking at moving to Penticton, and the home he’s been looking at is… well, its last occupants died, and now they haunt the place with dated design decisions.

Plum and yellow can work as a design ethos but it looks dingy, here.

> Futzing around on social media, as one does, I recently stumbled upon a meme that hit close to home. Over a picture-patterned sofa in an autumnal-colored velour with scrolling dark wood trim, it declared, “Everyone’s grandparents had this couch. Everyone’s.” I paused, because my grandmother did, in fact, have this exact type of couch.

ok, yes, but what **really** caught my attention was the realtor:

{{<imgwebp src="realtor2.png">}}

This be-soul-patched man has decided that the best way to sell a place in plum and yellow would be to BECOME the plum and yellow.

{{<imgwebp src="realtor3.png">}}

He’s careful to try and frame every shot of this home in front of one of the big windows because what sells this place is definitely the view and not the part on the inside.

{{<imgwebp src="realtor4.png">}}

I don't know what to say: if your realtor is not this dedicated to selling your home, you should stop working with them and
work with _this guy_ instead, he's clearly putting in the effort.

Normally I try to keep my blog posts at least a little bit general-audience, but this is
exclusively Balatro DEEP LORE which is only _maybe_ interesting to people who obsess over this game.
{{< /admonition >}}

okay, so, I hear on the _grapevine_ that Black Deck Gold Stake is the nastiest challenge in Balatro.

<!--more-->

And, yeah, it's... it's pretty hard. It's a bear, but I managed to finally, eventually, crack through Black Deck Gold Stake. Even this, possibly the meanest of the Gold Stake runs, still only took ... well, quite a lot of tries, but it was doable.

then I hit the Golden Needle challenge in the Challenge deck.

It's not even the _final challenge_, "Cruelty" and "Jokerless" come afterwards, but it turns out, Cruelty and Jokerless are not _too bad_. I managed to beat Jokerless on only my second try with a 4-of-a-kind build.

no, Golden Needle. It took _weeks_, and I'd estimate upwards of a hundred tries. I am pretty sure it is the hardest single challenge in Balatro.

You start with $10, a Credit Card joker, and _6 discards per turn_, whoa, that's so many discards!

The problem? 1 hand per turn, and using the discards costs $1 each.

Thanks to the 1 hand per turn limitation, your economy is going to be _so busted_ - if it takes you 4 discards to get to a hand that will beat the round, you've broken even: no money for you.

Black Deck is considered the most punishing deck in the game because you only get 2 hands and you can _still add more hands to that with jokers or tokens_. 2 hands is _a luxury_. Golden Needle not only forces you to work with 1 hand the whole time, you can't even add more hands because all of the hand-adding jokers are verboten.

I finally beat Golden Needle today, with a pretty lucky build that involved **Hanging Chad** and getting _very lucky_ with a single glass 3 that didn't break juuust long enough to scrape past Ante 8.

I hate Golden Needle and want it to die.

The argument that Balatro isn't actually very fun at higher stakes because it forces you into a handful of viable builds? Totally legitimate, and Golden Needle is _this ramped up to 11_ because the number of actually viable Golden Needle builds are _incredibly small_ and thanks to your weak econ and being stuck with 1 hand _every round_, surviving long enough to put together ANY build is very hard.

But I'm done. I did it. I beat all of Balatro's challenges. I collected all of the cards. I beat the highest stake with the hardest deck.

I mean, there's still "Gold Stake all decks" which I'll get through eventually, organically, if I keep playing this on my phone casually.

And there's "Gold Stake all jokers" which I might get through eventually, also, but aside from the WAR OF ATTRITION goals, I think I can say I've about _beaten_ Balatro.

------------------

## Now I'm Going To Talk About My Top 10 Balatro Jokers For A Bit, Because I Want To, Please Only Read This If You Are A Crazy Person

The top jokers in my collection make my winning strategy all too clear. These are, in my opinion, the heavyweight champion jokers of Balatro.

![](./jokers.png)

![](./consumables.png)

**Hanging Chad** is, in my opinion, the _third best joker in Balatro_, behind only the copy jokers (Blueprint and Brainstorm) - and Hanging Chad is **Common**, while the copy jokers are Rare, so you're going to see a lot more Hanging Chad.

Honestly, a lot of the time what you're copying with Blueprint? Hanging Chad.

All it does is retrigger your first played card, 2 times in a row. Why so good?

Retriggers are insanely useful, and a card that retriggers _anything_, _twice_ means that any face card becomes a Bonus card, any Bonus card becomes +100 chips, any +4 Mult card becomes +12 mult, any glass card becomes an X8 mult card - so, a joker that provides +100 chips, +12 mult, or a staggering X8 mult is _already_ pulling its weight in your joker deck. It's also flexible: if you're hurting for chips, it can provide chips. If you're hurting for mult, it can provide mult.

But that's not even the start of it because it takes _literally any_ joker that triggers off of a card _or_ any effect or joker that _also_ provides retriggers and jumps them into the stratosphere. Hanging Chad is a legitimately powerful joker on its own _before_ ALSO being one of the best combo enablers in the game.

The four jokers that give you +3 mult per card matching a specific suit? Well, that plus a Hanging Chad makes +12 mult - nothing to sneeze at, and that _stacks_ with any other effects - a Mult Club that provides +4 mult (from the "Mult" modifier and +3 mult (from the Club) is going to get up to a nice +21 mult - that's a solid late-game mult joker and applying "mult" to a Club is something you can do from the first shop in the game.

When localthunk inevitably nerfs Hanging Chad I'm going to pour one out for this joker.

Hanging Chad's best friend, **Photograph**, is also in my top 10, although much lower because it's not nearly as useful on its own as Hanging Chad - it's there _just in case_ Chad comes around. Photograph gives the first face card you play a X2 mult bonus. Because card-based-mult-mult happens _before_ the rest of your mult stack (if you understood this, you're huffing nearly as much Balatro as I am) - on its own it is good for maybe 2-7 mult unless you've been hitting the celestial cards pretty hard, making it ... pretty weak.

A Hanging Chad and a Photograph make that face card into X2, X2, X2, which is an X8 modifier on your base mult: that's a +38 multiplier on even a _base tier Full House_, and that scales up quickly with Celestial cards making it an extremely powerful combo. That's better than two +15 mult jokers, which are some of the stronger mult jokers.

But that effect _just keeps on stacking_. If you hit a glass card with it? Now that's not 2^3 (8), that's 2^6, an x64 multiplier, so a Full House is now +256 - combine that with _any_ chip joker and scale it even gently and you're cruising through Ante 8 no problem.

If what you crave is darker, infinite mode, getting into the _scientific notation_, well, that effect just keeps on stacking. Add the joker that retriggers all face cards? Add a red seal? Add a blueprint? Add a brainstorm? Now our _multiplier_ is getting deep into scientific notation - not our _score_ - our _multiplier_. This'll get you into the forbidden antes, no problem. With a combo that starts with 2 common jokers. Nice.

One of the other things is that most of the rest of the well-known insanely broken joker combos - Baron, Mime, and Red Seal Kings, or Idol and _every card in your deck is the same card_, also require an enormous amount of setup, to the point where they're not actually good builds for trying to take down high stake runs: they're simply too impractical to set up on anything but a run where you're already Killing It.

Compared to all that, **Swashbuckler** is pretty boring. He gets +mult equal to the sell value of all of your other Jokers.  Thing is, though - that reliably makes him at least a +8-12 mult joker (nothing to sneeze at, that's solid) but also gets more value out of any expensive joker, including rare, uncommon, holographic, polychrome, or foil jokers - which you _already want to take anyways_. Swashbuckler has synergy with _every expensive card in the game_ and you **want** every expensive card in the game - making Swashbuckler just a slightly better **Abstract Joker** (+3 mult per joker, including itself - which provides a little more mult on average, but comboes with nothing). Also, I really, really like the Swashbuckler+Gift Card and Swashbuckler+Egg combinations.

Okay, then there's **Supernova**, **Green Joker**, and **Ride The Bus**, which are each jokers that get +1 mult every time you play a hand - Supernova scales the hand you play _most often_ with no ill-effects, whereas Green Joker and Ride The Bus scale uniformly but can lose their mult - Green Joker loses 1 mult every time you discard, Ride The Bus loses _all_ mult if you happen to play a face card.

That sounds _really bad_ - +1 mult? Pfeh, trash - and you can't play face cards? Ever? Too harsh!

Okay, but, like, if you can arrange it so that you're playing 4 hands every round - expensive, but you can do it - that's +4 mult every round. If you have two of these cards, that's +8 mult every round. "Playing hands" is one of the easiest scaling routes in the game and you can easily get these jokers into the 30-40 mult territory by Ante 8, which is Good, that's a Good Joker - also, when they stop scaling as well, that's because your hands are TOO POWERFUL and closing out the round _too quickly_, but that's a good problem to have, it means you're ahead of the scaling curve. Win win.  Combine with _any_ X3 joker and a chips joker and you've probably won Ante 8.

Everyone knows why **Blueprint** and **Brainstorm** are the best jokers in the game, right? They're just _your best joker_, _again_, and you can _always_ rearrange your jokers, so Blueprint is _always_ the best joker. You have a +45 Ride The Bus? Now you have two! You have an X3 joker that only activates once in a while? Now it's two X3 jokers when that happens! Have a joker that does something cool at the beginning of the round? Now two cool things happen! Get 3 extra hands per round from your Burglar? Now you get 6 extra hands per round, AND you still get to copy other jokers!

**Burglar** seems bad at first - you trade all of your discards for +3 hands? Well those hands aren't going to be very GOOD if you can't _discard cards_ , right? Well, yeah - but - a hand is better than a discard, right? You remove the cards _and_ you get the points for the cards you removed. Plus Hands are worth _money_ - Burglar is secretly an Econ joker, because +3 hands is +3$ - not a great Econ joker, but free money is free money. Also, uh, you may have noticed that a whole lot of my favorite jokers _scale better the more hands you play_.

Really, once you've got hand-scaling going, the only thing you need to win the ante is an mult-mult joker - I have a lot of favorites here - Drivers' License (X3 if you have >16 enhanced cards) is pretty good, Blackboard (X3 if you leave only black cards in your hand) is pretty good, Card Sharp (X3 if you've played this hand before, this round) is _very_ good with my "lots of shitty hands" strategies (although Card Sharp is basically hard-countered by The Needle AND The Eye, both of which have ended a lot of my runs) - but the one that made it into my top 10 was good ol' **Hologram**, which is, in my opinion, the easiest mult-mult scaling in the whole game. "Oh, I need to add cards to my deck?" that is already not a hard thing to do, hit a couple of shops and you're at X2 already.

Magic: the Gathering really captured my heart from a young age. There's something really compelling about _building a deck_ and doing _fights_ with it.

I kinda drifted away from it, though. It's an _expensive_ hobby, and the "C" part of CCG never really appealed to me: I derive little joy from _collecting_.

<!--more-->

__"But Curtis, you have terabytes of pirated content and you clearly derive some joy from the act of both adding to and managing that collection."__

That's _curating_, not _collecting_.

Anyways, when I was young, MTG kinda just had the one format and it was barely-limited 40-card decks, which wasn't a very good format.

* _Pay to Win_: better cards will win more often and you can pay more for better cards.
* _Well-Defined Competitive Meta_: in the competitive scene, everybody gets to know what kind of deck is dominant and has to build for/with full knowledge of the entire competitive scene, which includes which (expensive) cards are mandatory to collect.
* _Turn One Infinite Combo_: With so many cards in the pool, players were bound to find cards that could interact to produce _infinite goblins on turn one_ or _something like that_.
* _The Berenstain Bears and Too Many Cards to Memorize_: As the card pool grew and grew, the number of cards people had to be aware of _also_ grew enormously.
* _Rarity_ : Getting good cards involves booster pack gambling, and, well:

{{<imgwebp src="suckers.png">}}

Anyhow: more modern _formats_ of M:tG attack some of these problems head on.

One solution is that M:tG moved towards, near immediately, was rolling editions and active ban lists. Only the past handful of M:tG editions are _street legal_ (constricting the number of card interactions the designers have to consider), and cards that utterly ruin the meta end up on ban lists so that they don't completely overrun tournament play.

## Commander

The Commander format changes the deckbuilding and game rules pretty significantly: it allows for some of the most expansive deckbuilding by mandating _exactly_ 100 cards and mandating _no duplicates_. Players can fill their decks with nasty and destructive infinite combos, and wildly over-powered $20 collector's item cards, but with such large decks these combos are _unreliable_.

Commander is a "collector who wants to flex a little" format. I a-little-bit-fondly remember spending a little time and more money than I care to admit (I can't remember how much, less than a hundred dollars) building a couple of Commander decks by cherry-picking exactly which cards I wanted from the internet and ordering them as a block.

There was a balanced, fun, interesting Nekusar the Mindrazer build that focused on _giving the other players cards_. It's not too bad to play against because _while it does a load of damage_, it also gives you enormous card advantage while it does that.

![](./nekusar.png)

"Did you build a mill deck in Commander? That's crazy!"

nah it kinda works and it's fun. team Nekusar. toot toot.

I also built a Krenko: Mob Boss deck that I was politely asked to retire forever because it was disgustingly powerful.

![](./krenko.png)

Seriously, this motherfucker is like the Ryzen 7 of Magic: the Gathering. He's been in print forever so he's available for a toonie, goblins are some of the cheapest and most plentiful creatures in Magic-dom - I dare you to find better price: performance in a Commander.

Anyways, I donated my Magic cards to one of my younger brother's cube projects, <small>I think?</small>, and haven't seen them again since.

## Draft

Commander is still a collector's game, a "pay to win" game. My Krenko deck was something I had to curate and assemble myself. It was a neat novelty, but I wasn't that sad to see it go.

A format where everybody has a much more even chance to win? Well, there's Draft.

I've only played in a handful of drafts, ever. I ran one for my younger brothers' bachelor party weekend many moons ago. You buy a shit-load of booster packs (3 per player),  and everyone plays a little game where they open a pack, pick a card, and pass the remaining cards around in a circle, picking and passing until the cards are all distributed.

Sometimes trades are allowed after the draft? It depends on the situation.

Canny drafters should end up with a deck that's pretty powerful - but not _too_ powerful.

Then, players play with the decks they have constructed.

This solves a lot of M:tG problems, in my opinion: you _can't_ pay to win, you can't assemble a game-breaking turn one infinite-combo... and if you're lucky, you can play with a group of people who aren't _intimately aware of the competitive meta_, making it possible to have fun, still, with a pretty mediocre deck.

In fact, my biggest problem with drafts is that, uh...

well, playing a draft with friends creates a LOT of Magic games, and...

I don't actually like playing Magic: the Gathering that much.

## The Trouble with Deckbuilding

I think it is more fun to _build a M:tG deck_ than it is to _actually play M:tG_.

The game itself is fussy, dense, sluggish, filled with unfair-feeling randomness.

In fact, I think this is the case for a _lot_ of games where you spend a lot of time tuning your deck up-front.

On top of that, the social context of games like this makes it harder to arrange games with your friends: in order for a game to take place, every player must buy in with _a deck arranged according to a rule-set pre-arranged for the game you're playing_.

This is a game where playing it casually is near impossible, because the only practical way to play it is in an _event_ format, which calls for a _lot_ of buy-in.

It'd take something pretty special and unusual to get me to run another Magic draf-

oh

oh no

![](./terra.png)

The Final Fantasy decks are proving immediately _very popular_ so it'll be a while before they're reliably _in print_ and _sealed_ without paying wild scalper prices for cards in them, but if the cost is ever under control I might.. consider... a Final Fantasy draft. For old times' sake.

## Netrunner

{{< imgwebp src="stacks.png">}}

Netrunner!

One of the nice things about Netrunner is that it is a "LCG", not a "CCG": a "living card game", not a "collectible card game".

The difference? In an LCG, while new cards get printed periodically, there's no _rarity_ or _gambling_, you can just _buy whatever cards you want_. The company that makes the cards just releases new sets every now and again, and you buy them.

Oh, also: the IP is now abandonware, and a company named ~~NISEI~~ Null Signal Games exists: devoted enthusiasts now make and manage Netrunner despite having (AFAICT) no actual claim on the IP:

[I Just Printed the Entire NISEI System Gateway at Home; Learn From My Mistakes](/posts/2022/nisei/)

Also, despite releasing the game for free as print-and-play, they are actually increasingly unfriendly towards Print & Play players - even in my Reddit post about printing the NISEI System Gateway they intruded to "how dare you" about not paying for their print-on-demand cards from MPC for _over a hundred Canadian dollars_, and have since reduced the resolution of their print + play cards significantly to try and drive sales to their product-that-they-don't-actually-have-the-rights-to-sell-as-far-as-I-can-tell.

Aaaanyhoo:

![](./godspeed.png)

_this is the part where the plan fell apart_, I could not convince Tiffany that Netrunner was worth playing, she played a couple of noncommittal token rounds with me but never really got in to it - which, considering the hours and hours I had spent individually cutting and sleeving hundreds of these cards, was _not a worthwhile use of my time_.

Honestly, Netrunner proved not terribly amateur friendly.

The gameplay revolves around protecting assets with Ice as a Corp, and trying to break that Ice and steal the assets as a Runner.

The asymmetric peek-a-boo runner-vs-corp gameplay is... okay, but while you're learning it is _all too easy_ to find yourself in an utterly hopeless game, trapped for 20 minutes while a corp stomps all over you because you can't find an Icebreaker you desperately need - or trapped for 20 minutes while a runner stomps all over you because you can't find Ice you desperately need. In fact, _building your own deck_ without too much advice from the internet is a recipe for getting stomped in exactly this way because building a balanced Netrunner deck is _much harder than building a Magic: the Gathering deck_ (because the gameplay of Netrunner is so abstract), which is _already_ much harder than Just Playing a Regular Board Game.

Magic: the Gathering is very obviously the game that inspired the Cheese Tasting Phase:

{{<youtube
EBIsZlV1jHk
>}}

but games of Netrunner devolve into Cheese Tasting _so much more severely than M:tG ever did_.

anyways, if you _do_ want to play Netrunner, I think the actual recommended way to play is just to polish your build on netrunnerdb.com and play a buttload of Netrunner on jinteki.net with random strangers.  In fact, I think that is just _how modern Netrunner is actually played_.

It's less of a card game and more of a wiki/database/video game hybrid at this point.

## The Arkham Horror TCG

![](./roland.png)
![](./shotgun.png)

you're still building a deck in this one, but it's to play a co-operative game!

I had a lot of thoughts about this already:
[Arkham Horror TCG](/posts/2021/arkham_horror_tcg)

Tiff and I played a full campaign! It's fun, and as I mentioned earlier it's out there solving problems with both Android: Netrunner AND Arkham Horror. In that article, I focused on some of the Arkham Horror problems it solves handily - like co-op quarterbacking, and the unfocused "misc. horror happens" decks creating a Very random atmosphere.

However, here, I could focus on some of the Netrunner problems that Arkham Horror solves: by simple virtue of being a _co-operative_ deckbuilding game, suddenly all of the problems of getting _lost in the meta_ disappear. You're not trying to build a good deck to _utterly wreck_ your friends, you're doing it to _try and save them from otherworldly horrors_. Tiff wasn't irritated when I managed a clever move with the almighty Dynamite card, she was happy!

It doesn't matter which cards you have in the card pool: the cards you have are the cards you have. Build some investigators and get horror-in'!

{{<youtube
3WA16gyRZyY
>}}

But it has downsides, too. It's still a lot of _pretty stressful_ up-front effort to try and build a good investigator deck.

The individual campaign entries each feature custom rules: the game wants you constantly on your toes but that means your deck might be absolutely terrible at the goal for one particular chapter, and also: some chapters are just _a lot more fun/difficult/playable than others_. Every campaign has "the chapter that everyone thinks is pretty shit".

The game's base rules also really discourage _changing your deck_ once you've started a campaign - a rule that I pretty thoroughly discarded as we were learning the game, because _getting stuck for multiple sessions with a bad deck_ is _no bueno_. A little bit of creative deck modification never hurt anyone.

Also: when we failed the campaign halfway through? Instead of starting the campaign again from the beginning, as intended, we just started again from the _part of the campaign that we failed_.


## Just Playing a Drafting Game

A big part of doing well in Magic: the Gathering drafts is... well, playing the draft mini-game to try and get the best deck!

But drafting in-and-of-itself is a skillset.

Heck, one of my favorite games for a few years was all draft and no... the other part.

{{<imgwebp src="7wonders.png">}}

7 Wonders is a game of _just draft_. _Only draft_. Draft the best deck, and you win.

Drafting is fun in and of itself, and drafting, as a mechanic, has been showing up in more and more games.

Simpler than 7 Wonders is Sushi Go! , a drafting game so simple you could play it with children, or your parents.

{{<imgwebp src="sushigo.png">}}

And there's The Isle of Cats, a game where you draft cards that let you attract tetromino-shaped cats on to your boat, which honestly scratches multiple very real itches in my brain at the same time:

{{<imgwebp src="isle_of_cats.png">}}

 I should crack this one out again, soon. caaaaaaats.

## Deckbuilding During Gameplay

{{<imgwebp src="dominion.png">}}

Almost 20 years ago, this masterpiece came out: a game where you set out a menu of possible cards to add to your deck, and buy cards to add to your deck _during play_.

I don't... play Dominion often, any more. I still have most of the cards, from multiple sets,  although they are in pretty battered condition: but the big reason why I don't play Dominion so much any more is that this utterly incredible idea got adopted IMMEDIATELY into the board gaming world as a first-class Concept that now gets included in all kinds of games - many of them more refined and fun than original-recipe Dominion.

For example, Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer, a game I liked enough that I made a partially-AI-generated print-and-play snowclone of it ( https://cube-drone.itch.io/attack-and-dethrone ) a few years before AI generated art became _very easy_ and _very common_.  I made an Geforce RTX 1080 work _very hard_ on that.

"Deckbuilder" is fun on its own, but it's also an ingredient that works well in other kinds of game.

Mix Deckbuilder into your racing game? Well that's The Quest for El Dorado, which is very fun! Build a deck to get through this jungle as quickly as you can!

{{<imgwebp src="eldorado.png">}}

Mix El Dorado with a dash of Quacks of Quedlinburg, a push-your-luck game, and you end up with Cubitos, which a dice-based push-your-luck deckbuilder!  Sure, we're getting a little lost in the sauce with game mechanics here but it _still works pretty well_.

{{<imgwebp src="cubitos.png">}}

Oh, but mix deckbuilding with _roguelike_ mechanics and you end up with the King, the grand-daddy, the great big boy that easily, handily hammered its way near to the top of the heap of my most played games of all time:

## Slay the Spire

{{<imgwebp src="slay_the_spire.png">}}

Built by... a bunch of Netrunner enthusiasts.

I _LOVE_ Slay the Spire. I hit A17 with each of the game's four decks on my iPhone after hundreds of hours of gameplay, and then I moved to my new Android, where I bought Slay the Spire again, and now I'm just chillin' at the bottom of the spire getting ready to start climbing all over.

[Slay the Spire's Opening Monsters Won't Deal 10 Damage](/posts/2022/slay_the_spire)

## Slay the Spire: The Board Game

Slay the Spire is very good, but explicitly single player. Slay the Spire: The Board Game is a co-operative experience where you get to bring all four of the Slay the Spire decks to the table at the same time, each of you working together to try to slay the titular _spire_ as a TEAM.

As I mentioned about Arkham Horror: TCG above, Co-op and deckbuilding work really well together!  Slay the Spire is HARD, and when someone's deck starts to pop off, it creates _room for everyone else to breathe a little_. On top of that, thanks to Slay the Spire's innovative "build the deck as you go" format, nobody has to do a bunch of prep building a deck beforehand like they would with Arkham Horror: TCG.

{{<youtube
Mn0nBjqgBcs
>}}

But also: Slay the Spire: the Board Game is HARD, and complicated, and a lot of work. Like: it's a complicated video game, but when you're playing the video game the _video game does a lot of the work for you_. When you're playing Slay the Spire in person, a _real person_ has to figure out how many hit points each of the games' many gremlins has.

The best way to get my friends to agree to play it with me was to breathlessly recommend Slay the Spire the iPhone game _dozens of times in conversations with them_ until they all got as addicted to the mobile game as I was, then finally _once the pump was primed_ roll out the gigantic board game edition.

It went so well, though. I got to play this game all the way to the end of the Spire. Twice. At one point we played it while camping, with friends, in the outdoors.

{{<imgwebp src="camping.png">}}

this day in late 2024 was the highest point of multiple consecutive decades of me trying to manufacture A Good Time With Collectible Card Games:

_playing Slay the Spire co-operatively with friends combined all of the stuff I've wanted from all of these systems over the years_.  It's got the good co-op I wanted from Arkham Horror. It's got the good deckbuilding I wanted from Magic: the Gathering. It's got drafting moments that feel enormously important but there's not a hint of hate-drafting.

## Inscryption

> {{<imgwebp src="inscryption.png">}}
> i hope it isn't apparent where I stole this image from


good lord above if you like narrative puzzle games and card games and you haven't played Inscryption yet I want to shake you until you do, it is unbelievably good

## Balatro

after Slay the Spire: loads, LOADS of games inspired by Slay the Spire.

in my 2024 GOTY roundup, I gave "every Slay the Spire inspired game I played" a collective spot at **#3** because there were a lot of 'em and I wanted to fold them all together in "pretty damn good" territory.

Then, of course, I gave Balatro **#1**.

Again, I was pretty far into unlocking everything and racking up the gold stake wins on my iPhone when I switched to Android, only to devote myself to _starting the whole project all over again_. Just because Balatro is very good.

It's the deckbuilding roguelike stripped down almost to the studs. It's not _that_ complicated, but it's just complicated _enough_.

{{<imgwebp src="balatro.png">}}

It's not better than Slay the Spire. It's _really good_, though.

This is also one of the few that I'd _try_ to recommend to my parents. I think most people could get good and addicted to Balatro.

## Earthborne Rangers

Look, I trust SUSD pretty well with the old recommendinos - they're not 100% right about what I'll like (Tom's recommendations tend to be the worst for me, he's just A Different Gamer than I Am) but by and large they are a trusted source of interesting recommendations for me,

and as a result, this frigging YouTube channel probably costs me a few hundred bucks a year.

{{<youtube
crbv1SzaYQk
>}}

They gave Earthborne Rangers _two_ stickers. TWO!  I had _no choice_ but to to kickstart its second printing and wait over a year to see what they're going on about, for a game that Matt Lees was so ungodly excited about that he genuinely believed that Shut Up & Sit Down should introduce some kind of _new recommendation tier_ for the game:

{{<imgwebp src="double.png">}}

(I've been assured that my copy will be along some time in the June-ish 2025 territory)

It's... very clearly got a lot in common with the Arkham Horror TCG pedigree, being a game where you build a deck to tackle a co-operative problem solving situation.

but Matt here assures me that that's not the whole story:

{{<imgwebp src="matt.png">}}

> so, tonally, Earthborne Rangers is more "Avatar: the Last Airbender" to Arkham Horror's "Cabinet of Curiosities"
> and if it was just a less oppressive, more expressive version of that game it would already be great
> but
> it's just loads more, it's so much more than that

so, I'm excited to give this one a try when it finally shows up

I build a new auth system about once a year.

That's a weird hobby, but, it's, like, incidental to the actual hobby: I start a lot of projects using new technologies, and the first thing I have to figure out in these new technologies is always _auth_.

And every time I do, after I've got most of auth working, I have to figure out why my test suite takes 500+ms to run per test, despite my using an all-local stack of generally pretty performant technologies - in fact, a lot of the time it feels like the _more_ modern and performant my stack is, the slower all of these tests are.

And every time, I spend a whole evening investigating _why this happens_.

And every time, I eventually re-discover the same result:

**it's password hashing, dummy.**

I mentioned this 2 years ago, as a trick that I figured out to make testing VRChat's enormous backend noticeably faster:

![](./tuning.png)

it turns out, enforcing byzantine best-in-class Argon2 anti-brute-force password hashing technology while creating a disposable test user for every single test? That's just heating up the environment for no good reason.

There are ways around this - I've done things like
* tuning the password hasher to a much lower work value in dev
* replacing the password hasher with md5 in dev
* and
* just having a function that poops a fully created user as quickly as possible into dev without bothering with ANY of the regular user creation flow


these are all perfectly cromulent strategies, but

ask yourself this:

are my integration tests manufacturing hundreds of test users and doing full-fat password hashing for each one?

if so, maybe give'r one a these:

So, 25 years after it launched, I finally read House of Leaves.

<!--more-->

That time I read Homestuck 5 times over 5 consecutive {{< sidenote years >}}
I feel like I should write a very long blog post about this sometime.
{{< /sidenote >}}:

So I've been _aware_ of House of Leaves for a long time, but I wasn't willing to fully tackle it until I had a _large format full-color e-reader_.

Which, uh: I guess I've had one of those for a little over a year now.

So I guess it is _time_.

I'll even write an article about

with a bunch of images that I stole from the r/houseofleaves subreddit because they are funny and illustrative.

## Reading Patterns

The first 50 pages of House of Leaves took me weeks to read. I'd open it, power through some boring-ass text, fail to see what the deal was, and put it back down.

The last 700 pages of House of Leaves took me 2 days to read. Once I got in to it, it became harder to put down.

{{<imgwebp src="beefus.png">}}

-----

## This Is Not For You

The first line of the book. It's become something of a mantra for the community surrounding House of Leaves. It's a _warning_, intended to give this horror story some edge. Beware this tome!

I think this line puts in some work to shield the book from criticism, too: if you like the book: great! If you don't like the book? Well, it's not _for_ you.

I bet you'd live to criticize that, wouldn't you, you Critics! But you can't. It's not _for_ you.

[![](./criticism.png)](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/24/the-adventures-of-twisp-and-catsby)

This is also, uh, maybe a good time to talk a little bit about how _divisive_ House of Leaves is.

Loved by many, hated by many:

[![](./wil.png)](./wil.png)

I wanted to characterize the reviews of this book as bimodal, mostly 5 star reviews or 1 star reviews, "love it or hate it", but the data didn't bear out my hypothesis: mostly people like House of Leaves.

![](./prettygood.png)

Detractors of the book claim that House of Leaves is complex for complexity's sake, self important, plodding, rambling, either they didn't finish it or they finished it and they regretted it.

One histrionic one-star review claims that the books' popularity is actually a symptom of some greater disease in society, that art itself is collapsing around him:

![](./mad1.png)
![](./mad2.png)

_to lighten the mood he opines that books should have more intercourse with him_

![](./intercourse.png)

(uh, he didn't mean it that way, he meant that part of the book is the relationship you form with the book, but the line is too funny not to include at face value.)

Fans of the book will then just turn around and go "it's not _for_ you".

{{<imgwebp src="notforyou.png">}}

There's an in-group out-group mentality to that: this is not for _you_. It's for _me_. Some people _get it_ and some people _don't_. **I** get it.

Beyond that, though, what does "this book is not for you" mean, at the beginning of the book, in Johnny Truant's
{{< sidenote font >}}
oh, btw, every narrator of this book is written with a different typeface.
{{< /sidenote >}}?


Well, it could mean any number of things, each interpretation supported by the text:

* This is a note from Johnny Truant to _himself_, pointing out that this book is potentially dangerous to his
{{< sidenote sanity >}}
which: it is, good call Johnny
{{< /sidenote >}}.
* This is a note from Johnny Truant to _the potential reader of the text_, warning them that this book is potentially dangerous to their

which: it is not, bad call Johnny
{{< /sidenote >}}.
* This is meant to indicate that Johnny took on the task of compiling this book for personal reasons, rather than out of a desire to share it with the

Definitely true: Johnny never seems to care about the book's popularity - he is compiling it for his own, personal reasons.
{{< /sidenote >}}.
* Mark Danielewski wants you to know that he doesn't care if you like this book, because _he_ wrote it following the death of his own father as a meditation on the complex feelings one gets when they grieve a parent who was not always kind to them.

Okay, there we go, we've made it through the first line of the book, only about ten thousand more to go.

## Horror Thrives Off of Ambiguity

![](./house.jpeg)

One of the failure states of horror, one that Tiff and I frequently discuss, is that it is unbelievably difficult to _stick the landing_.

Horror is better when it goes underexplained: spooky things don't tend to _remain spooky_ under careful examination.

In this 30-minute
{{< sidenote long >}}
by this youtuber's current standards, this is an unbelievably short video
{{< /sidenote >}}
YouTube video, Hbomberguy makes the point that horror suffered in theaters and thrived on VHS partially because _the format itself_ obscured the fine details: horror is more terrifying if it's blurry and hard to parse.

{{<youtube xbZMqS-fW-8>}}

This makes long-form horror incredibly difficult. Longer horror series tend towards separating into episodic horror stories &mdash; Black Mirror, Twilight Zone, the _excellent_ [The Fall of the House of Usher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_House_of_Usher_(miniseries)), ... Goosebumps, Are You Afraid of the Dark: and that's partially because horror just works _better_ in shorter form.

So in order for longer-form horror to thrive, it has to be, well, incredibly oblique.

And boy, does House of Leaves understand the assignment.

## Puzzle-Box Writing

In fact, a lot of the time it does this _too well_: House of Leaves is one of a long series of prominent media properties that _raises a lot of questions_ and doesn't seem too concerned about _answering them, ever_.

One of the most prominent questions raised by the book is that the word "house" is always written in blue, regardless of who's narrating at any given moment.

![](./blue.webp)

Why? Why is "house" always blue? It can't be a persistent tic of any of the books' individual narrators, because then it wouldn't be consistent throughout the whole book.

Of _course_ this is never explicitly explained.

The real answer to the question of why the word "house" is always blue is, I think, ultimately, "because that's a compelling question to ask the reader". It is a question that makes you want to dig to find an answer.

This was, uh, a major criticism of shows like Lost and the unsatisfying ending of X-Files (neither of which I've seen, BTW, I'm aware of these criticisms only through cultural osmosis):

{{<imgwebp src="lost.png">}}

They raise a lot of _juicy questions_ because juicy questions get people engaged, but then they never answer them to any satisfaction, choosing to leave their solutions _up to the reader's imagination_.

This earned the derogatory term "puzzle-box screenwriting", and ... well, in a much _longer_ hbomberguy video, Harris goes on for multiple actual hours about how constantly raising juicy, leading questions _for their own sake_ and then just _abandoning them_ is actually a really shitty thing to do to your audience.

{{<youtube LkoGBOs5ecM>}}

I'll argue that House of
{{< sidenote Leaves >}}
and a different "puzzle box" obsession of mine, Homestuck. &mdash;

Homestuck actually explains almost everything, to full satisfaction, if you bother to close read it.
That's... well, rare, and nightmarishly difficult, although the method by which it accomplished this magic trick is actually hilarious in retrospect: Hussie raised impossibly complicated and difficult questions in his text, and Hussie wrote it **live**, which gave him access to a rabid, insane fan community who would put in mountains of effort creating impossibly detailed theories explaining how everything could, in fact, fit together in a satisfying way. Then Hussie just... read the forums and quietly implemented and validated the fan theories. This creates the impression that he's a brilliant author when, in fact, he just created compelling questions and crowdsourced the impossible solutions. Homestuck is a story about using clever temporal tricks and metanarrative to solve impossible problems where ALSO the author is using clever temporal tricks and metanarrative to solve an impossible problem, which is... pretty great actually.
{{< /sidenote >}}
manages to stick these landings _better_ than Sherlock, or Lost - they're all properties who introduce a lot of _complexity for its own sake_ and _juicy questions that are hard to answer_, but Sherlock and Lost felt like betrayals when they didn't actually have any good answers in them.

House of Leaves doesn't explain everything - and this powers a one-star sense of angry betrayal amongst some of its readers - but it makes its own refusal to explain itself _thematically important_.

House of Leaves is a book full of juicy, unanswered questions, but it executes a clever dodge by making itself _about_ juicy, unanswerable questions.

## The Structure

Talking about the book is going to require that I give you a brief look at what happens in it. Beware: past this point be spoilers (for a 25-year old book).

[![](./jackass.png)](https://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2005/12/05/as-regards-spoilification)

* Johnny Truant, a punk kid who's mostly interested in drugs and sex, comes into possession of the detailed, rambling, and mostly insane notes of Zampanó, an elderly blind man who was writing a book.
* The compilation of the book appeared to be something of an obsession for Zampanó.
* For some reason (the question of "why does Johnny DO this?" is actually one that I think is actually thoroughly answered by the text) Johnny decides to make it his mission in life to clean this book up and get it into a state where it could theoretically be published.
* This is that book: you're reading it now, so Johnny succeeded! But you're still getting the framing story of Johnny compiling the story through his constant elaborate footnotes that take over the story to tell you about what Johnny is up to.
*  The actual book is an academic treatise that closely examines "The Navidson Record", a short documentary film (imagine "The Blair Witch Project") covering explorations of a _very clearly evil_ house.
* _Even within the book_ The Navidson Record is dismissed by most of the academics discussing it as a hoax: but Zampanó clearly believes that this house is The Real Thing and makes a case that the events of The Navidson Record actually _happened_.
* But in a layered double-cross (that is explained in the first 20 pages by Johnny, so it's not a twist, even) it turns out that The Navidson Record and the academic discussion surrounding it are not real: most of its academic references are to books that never existed, the real people quoted in the book do not recognize the quotes they've given, and Johnny can find no evidence that the main characters of the book _exist at all_. The entire book is seemingly an invention of Zampanó. The Navidson Record is _not_ a hoax: it simply never existed in the first place.
* Compiling the book is difficult for Johnny - in compiling the book, Johnny slowly loses his mind, getting more and more trapped in nightmares and paranoid delusions and withdrawing from society.
* The book itself retells The Navidson Record in exhaustive detail
{{< sidenote detail. >}}
Most academic works don't, in fact, provide within themselves an exhaustive re-telling of the source material, but, of course, since the Navidson Record doesn't actually exist, we wouldn't be able to talk about it, really, if House of Leaves _didn't_ re-tell it.
{{< /sidenote >}}
* Within The Navidson Record, the photo-journalist, Will Navidson, moves into a house intending to have a _nice time_ with his family, only to discover increasing irregularities in the house's architecture.
* Measurements indicate that the house is, uh, just a little bigger on the inside than the outside? That's weird. Will Navidson becomes obsessed (obsession is a major theme in this book) with resolving this mystery.
* A freshly discovered door appears in the home, leading to... a dark hallway. Down the dark hallway? Another dark hallway, an endless procession of lightless hallways and rooms, all of them empty, all of them painted a charcoal black, the rooms getting bigger and more abstract the deeper Will explores.
* Behold: Impossible geometries!
![](./impossible.png)
* Will's claustrophobic wife insists that Will not explore this all by himself, causing _marital strife_.
* Will gets an Exploration Team interested in exploring the house, who bring ropes and lights and supplies.
* Whoops: the Exploration Team mostly just goes crazy and kills one another while they're in there.
* Everyone attempts to escape the house, and on the way _out_ the house starts wildly shifting in size and scale, doin' a few more kills but leaving Will's family mostly unscathed. They escape.
* Will's wife Karen takes the kids to New York while Will broods and obsesses over his footage.
* Eventually Will goes back in.
* Karen goes back to the house to find Will, but he isn't there.
* Johnny has a full schizophrenic break from reality, losing months at a time, his footnotes starting to appear out of chronological order, or describe events that never happened.
* After the book is released, Johnny appears to enjoy a moment of peace and relaxation.
* Johnny tells a story about a boy who died shortly after birth, shepherded by his oddly mystical mother.
* Karen braves the dark, despite the claustrophobia, to be with her husband. They escape once more, this time selling the damn house.
* The book ends.
* Some Zampanó appendices and footnotes.
* _(most of the stuff past this point was added after the fact for the second edition of the book)_
* included in the Appendices are all of the letters that Johnny saved from his mother, Pelafina, who wrote to him from the mental institution where she was kept after she, in a break from reality, attempted to strangle Johnny to death when he was 4 years old.
* at the end of the letters is included the notification that Johnny received from the institution when his mother committed suicide during one of her bad breaks.

and that's it, that's the book!

## The Book Itself Contorts

The thing that a lot of people remember about House of Leaves is that, in the parts that take place within the deepest and darkest parts of the house, the book's text gets wonky, contorting and shifting to force the reader to ... adjust to its strangeness.

{{<imgwebp src="contorts.png">}}
![](./contorts2.png)

this structural difficulty is _mostly_ saved for the parts of the book exploring the darkest depths of the house.

Another detail of the book is the near constant
{{< sidenote footnotes >}}
nobody else does this
{{< /sidenote >}}: in fact, Johnny Truant, arguably the main character of the whole book, exists
_only_ within the introduction and footnotes of this book.

## Johnny Gets Fingered

![](./fingered.png)

Johnny Truant, the unreliable narrator who compiled this whole tome, continuously interrupts the book's flow to tell these long, rambling stories about his happy-go lucky life of taking drugs with Lude, inventing elaborate stories on a dime in order to impress women (and hide from the much darker stories that he implies outline his actual past), and his myriad improbable sexual conquests.

![](./fingered2.png)

Fans of the book, of course, will defend that Johnny is enormously important to understanding the whole thing: even if it is just through footnotes, the book is _about_ Johnny, and establishing his character is just as important as the mock horror tale that exists within its pages.

Most of these stories are told in intense, lurid detail, however, and even fans of the book easily admit to getting sick and tired of Johnny's frequent and meaningless interruptions, especially in the first 100-odd pages of the book.

Even if the _point_ of these interludes is (I believe) to gradually call into question Johnny's reliability as a narrator... they're exhausting.

It's the topic of the [top reddit post _ever_](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofleaves/comments/1g23mfq/dear_reader/) on the `/houseofleaves` subreddit. And the next few after that.  Shut the hell up, Johnny.


## Zampanó Might Be Worse

Johnny may be irritating, but Zampanó is honestly pretty bad, too.

He apes a lot of conventions from academic writing, including _endless navel gazing_. He can't seem to form a complete thought without referencing a dozen other works: Zampanó is just presenting these ideas, he's not generating new ones.

But _of course_ Zampanó _is_ generating new ideas: his references are entirely
{{< sidenote fabricated >}}
ChatGPT learned it from Zampanó.
{{< /sidenote >}}, as is the entire _topic_ that his book covers.

When he uses _real_ references, he uses a sneaky technique that the book calls out: to appear more well-read than he actually is, he'll read a single primary source that brings in a number of quotes from secondary sources, then reference the secondary sources directly while leaving out the primary source.

You know, like when folks just read the Wikipedia article and _reference all of the things referenced by the Wikipedia article_ without mentioning that all of the work of compiling these references was just A Single Wikipedia Page All
{{< sidenote Along. >}}
This was the subject of YET ANOTHER hbomberguy video, I need to find a different _guy_ to reference, why is this one video essayist so frequently relevant in this particular discussion?
{{< /sidenote >}},

When people complain that House of Leaves is unbearably stuffy and pretentious but ultimately kind of hollow of meaning, it is generally Zampanó's writing that they are carping about.

## The Impossible Question of Who Wrote "House of Leaves"

I think one of the core mysteries of the book, and the one it is least willing to give up, is _who wrote what_. Every source of information in this book comes from an [unreliable narrator](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/UnreliableNarrator) who may or may not even exist. It's a 50 unreliable narrator pile-up!

That's why the blue "house" remains such a compelling mystery: it is a persistent detail _regardless of who's narrating_, and since the book itself exists within the story it raises the question: did one person write the whole thing? And if so, who?

Johnny, of course, is both a consummate liar and serial storyteller who invents elaborate stories as a defense mechanism and is revealed to be _significantly_ more intelligent and well read than he lets on. One of Zampanó's bad habits is including long stretches of quotations in other languages, which Johnny has to struggle to translate &mdash; but events later in the book conspire to reveal that Johnny may, in fact, just know these languages, his struggles in translation may be fabricated. _The only lasting record of Zampanó's existence_ appears to be Johnny's memories of him, as most of the people who could corroborate his existence are... dead, and also hard to corroborate. Zampanó is an odd and fanciful name, and Zampanó himself is blind and yet seems to have an awful lot to say about the visual composition of Will Navidson's photojournalism.

![](./blind.png)

Zampanó could absolutely be a fiction created by Johnny, his intense effort "compiling Zampanó's notes" instead disguising the even more intense effort of fabricating them.

Zampanó himself is revealed through the text to _also_ be a consummate liar, given that he has prepared an elaborate academic treatment of a documentary film that doesn't _actually exist_, stocked by a great many academic references that _also don't exist_.  To futher muddy the waters, in a footnote, Zampanó describes his desire to invent a mythological "perfect son",
going on to describe, in detail, what seems like a rough sketch of Johnny. It even includes a subtle jab at the sort of readers who would _ignore the Johnny footnotes_ just because they're unreadable trash.

Johnny could absolutely be a fiction created by Zampanó, an elderly blind man who always desired to have a child who _cared about his work_.

Johnny's very last words in the book describe a scene where a newborn baby (very like Johnny) dies in hospital in the arms of a woman who is very like his mother, Pelafina. Did Johnny exist or was he just a projection of a sad storyteller?

And, of course, Pelafina's footnotes also introduce this brilliant mad-woman who seems to constantly introduce themes and concepts that would later show up in House of Leaves. Are these concepts in House of Leaves because she was an enormous influence on Johnny, who subconsciously edited them into the text? Or because Johnny _fully wrote the text_? Or because Johnny died shortly after he was born, and Pelafina wrote the whole thing?

The question of _who invented what_, here, is both central to the mystery of House of Leaves and _utterly unanswerable_. Investigating it just leads one down rabbit hole after rabbit hole, as each path seems to draw you in while also defying any kind of explanatio...... oh damn.

Oh, damn.

## The Book Is The House, The House is the Book

I'm a sucker for meaningful framing devices.

It shows up in a lot of fiction, I also loved The Grand Budapest Hotel, a wonderful movie where the framing is key to its telling, and Asterios Polyp, a graphic novel where the form and structure of the novel echoed its _themes and direction_.

The book, House of Leaves, has a cover that's a little short. The cover of the book doesn't extend all of the way to the end of the pages. It's, uh, how do I say this, _bigger on the inside than the outside_.

House of Leaves, the book, is full of these long, meaningless, irritating digressions that go nowhere, and _also_ takes the time to explains to you in an aside that solving a labyrinth can be performed exhaustively, but that this would take forever, and suck, which is why the only way to get through at any kind of a clip is to _pick a path_, not going too fast or too slow but deciding your own pace and committing to it before you realize that _whoops, you've become irrecoverably lost_.

The way to read House of Leaves is to be a bit discerning about what you even _choose_ to read, made easier by some of Zampanó's longer interludes just being _him listing off various names of architects for 8 straight pages_.

Which is to say: like a labyrinth, you can navigate House of Leaves by working through it exhaustively, which sucks, or by choosing threads and pulling on them at your own pace, which will get you lost.

The book describes _a labyrinth_ that
demands to be explained, yet contains no answers and engenders obsession and madness from people who _demand_ those answers.

Also _the book itself_
demands to be explained, yet contains no answers and engenders obsession and madness from people who _demand_ those answers.

The main character of the book tries to fully understand the mysteries of the book and goes mad trying.

![](./mirror.png)

Seemingly an endless, infinite, self-referential loop, but actually pretty easily explained if you think about it.

## Technically, Nothing Happens

While there's a horror story _in here_, one of the most obvious conclusions to the story is that an increasingly schizophrenic Johnny inherited a huge pile of academic notes from a dead man, and it triggered a bunch of latent trauma, causing him to revise and revise and revise until it told the exact kind of elaborate and completely fabricated story that Johnny was prone to concocting.

![](./silvia.png)

Zampanó (the _least_ well defined character in this story) may or may not have been an invention of Johnny but whether or not he _is_ an invention of Johnny is hardly important, because Johnny's treatment of his materials is likely to be so comprehensive and warped that his original perspective would have been mostly overwritten anyways.

This book is nothing more than the ravings of an imaginary madman.

## The Actual Answer To The Impossible Question of Who Wrote "House of Leaves"?

Mark Danielewski, obviously. Someone had to point these mirrors at one another and then hand it to you like some kinda big fuckin' mystery.

![](./answer.png)

## Johnny's Mother's Impossible to Decipher Letter

The one question that the book always seems to attempt to answer, in the case of _most_ of its characters &mdash; even its second-order-fictitious-ones &mdash; is _why_ do they do any of this? Why do they become obsessed so easily?

Why are they projecting their own obsessions and madness on to this story?

Johnny, as the central character around which this whole tale revolves, is the one who gets the most exploration.

Johnny, it is revealed, has kept every letter his mother had ever sent him from her asylum. She was _enormously_ important to Johnny. She was afflicted with the same kind of paranoid schizophrenia as Johnny, but while Johnny's response to it was introspection and self-analysis, his mother Pelafina tended towards a kind of grandiose narcissism. He kept all of her letters, but she kept just one of his.

Pelafina would frequently mis-remember details, invent things out of whole cloth, generate pleasing stories to tell herself as a salve.

And when Pelafina became increasingly paranoid, she'd begin to layer encoded messages _into_ her messages to her son - encoded messages, that, when read, felt _more real_ (because of the effort involved in decoding them) but were, of course, still nonsense.

Then she sends this letter to her son.

![](./letter.webp)

It _seems_ pregnant with meaning, overflowing with a code that lies _just below the surface_. These words appear again and again throughout the book, they must be some kind of code &mdash; but I checked online, and 25 years later nobody has cracked it.

![](./code.jpeg)

Because there is nothing to crack.

Ultimately, at the center of all of this puzzle solving, it's just made-up nonsense, just overheated minds attributing meaning where none exists. It defies reason. It's just nonsense and we're reading too much in to it.

> [Page 633](https://www.reddit.com/r/houseofleaves/comments/j5ryae/notes_on_the_three_attic_whalestoe_letters/)
>
> This page. This fucking page. [I've spent a lot of time on this page.](https://imgur.com/9paUZEd.jpeg) I think that's maybe the point of it. Here, at the nucleus of Pelafina's madness, the riddle is unsolvable. Before, the meaning was concealed in codes, but no matter how much effort Johnny or the reader puts into these words, they [mean nothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_salad).
>
> *However.*
>
> The words may not mean much in themselves, but their significance is so enormous that any attempt to construct an all-encompassing interpretive lens for *House of Leaves* must take them into account. That's because they reappear all over the book. Not just words, but whole phrases appear in Johnny's poems, elsewhere in Pelafina's letters, and *even in Zampanò's writing.* For the sake of brevity and sanity, I will leave it there, and you can do whatever you want with it.

And that is kind of key to the whole book. You can easily imagine Johnny, desperate for communication from his mother, trained to find hidden codes and ciphers in everything, already prone to [apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia), poring over these words again and again and again, attempting to solve this unsolvable puzzle forever until it spirals out, destroying his life.

This is the same self-destructive impulse that could cause Johnny to compile House of Leaves, why he would do it despite it driving him mad.

This book is this page, too: a meaningless labyrinth, meant to be explored but not understood.
Like the [Codex Seraphinianus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codex_Seraphinianus) it's meant to _evoke_ internal consistency without needing to _contain_ it.

## That's Why It Works

A lot of people don't like House of Leaves because Zampanó is unbearably pretentious and Johnny is unbearably lewd, this is a an entirely valid complaint and I think a good reason to have not enjoyed House of Leaves.

A lot of people like House of Leaves because it's a rich, layered, seemingly-solvable mystery and they can devote many hours to trying to unearth its rich trove of mysteries.

![](./badtime.png)

A lot of people don't like House of Leaves because it's fundamentally an unsolvable mystery where most of the threads lead _nowhere_.

I think that House of Leaves works and is worthwhile because _it is thematically and structurally about unsolvable mysteries_. It's a rumination on the meaning and draw of unsolvable
{{< sidenote mysteries. >}}
Like, for example, the unsolvable mystery of death, which had just, at time of writing, claimed Mark's father, causing Mark himself to experience a bit of an unhealthy fixation with an unknowable concept. Grief, too, is a major theme of House of Leaves. The house is death. The house is grief.
{{< /sidenote >}}

The book is the house, the house is the book, and both the book and the house are impossible, unresolvable labyrinths concocted by grieving conmen with unhealthy fixations.

## Academic Faffing: This Book Demands To Be Discussed

![](./mmmyes.png)

Fascinating.

One feature of the book that honestly almost seems a little silly, even if it _is_ made up by Zampanó (or Johnny, depending on your interpretation), is just the sheer volume of words fictitiously spilled on the topic of The Navidson Record.

Zampanó discusses _hundreds_ of sources while compiling his notes. For a small documentary dismissed by most as a hoax, the amount of literary ink spilled on the topic of The Navidson Record is _wild_. At some point he alludes to folks writing hundred-page diatribes covering a single page of correspondence between Will and his wife &mdash; diatribes that Zampanó will helpfully summarize for your benefit.

This book is just as interested in the conversation surrounding the book as the book itself.  Which, again, is structural and self-referential: the open, unresolvable, puzzle-box nature of the book of course means that it is _itself_ nearly irresistable to TALK ABOUT, which is how I've managed to spill some 2000 words covering it so far.

The book invites that discussion while also containing within itself myriad examples of the kind of endless dissection that it so clearly invites.

It’s got that kind of “abstract art” quality to it where you can take a lot of different lenses to it and get something different each time, which is powered a lot by how vague and dense it is and how much you’re willing to bring to your particular read on it.

That’s a strength of metaphor-heavy, symbolic fiction, like… Moby Dick. That white whale was never just a whale, but when it comes time to determine what exactly it was, well — that’s an exercise for the reader. Get out the interpretive lenses baby, it’s time to cook.

No question, though, a lot of readers (myself included) can find that kind of inchoate storytelling frustrating.
**But what happened though!?!**

## Infohazard

_good god damn this book is hard to stop thinking about_

I’ll be chillin’ at work trying to put together Avatar Grembling or whatever the feature of the week is and suddenly I’ll just think “but was Johnny real tho”.

_this book is exactly the sort of infohazard it purports to be_

## Why Is The Internet Obsessed With This Book?

{{<youtube kMmBFnTfnn0>}}

Man Carrying Thing here makes the, I think really valuable point:

> so much of this book’s flaws, you can support by saying “that’s intentional”
>
> Johnny Truant and Zampano are two of the most obnoxious narrators but also the most obnoxious writers, and there is some pretentious writing in this book that is played to be the point?

Just because a book is metanarratively and thematically **about** being badly written, impenetrable, sexist, frustrating, self-contradictory, meaningless, and the topic of endless circular debate… doesn’t… mean it’s **not** badly written, impenetrable, sexist, frustrating, self-contradictory, meaningless, and the topic of endless circular debate.

Something can be fascinating and even self aware without being… y’know… {{< sidenote good. >}}
you know, like (he gestures around) me
{{< /sidenote >}}

Like, I love The Room because it’s a fascinating trainwreck and it’s fun to dig in to, but also The Room is objectively a terrible piece of fiction.

{{<youtube aNv-tH0Vmik>}}

Part of the reason that The Room succeeded where other terrible projects fail is that that it has that so-popular-in-the-2000s meta-narrative layer, just by accident:

The story’s heavy-handed, confusingly-told message of the perfect and flawless Tommy (played by himself) and his utter betrayal at the hands of a feminine wretch - it works because you can’t help but look at it and think about _who MADE this_?

And if you include the extra story that you concoct in your head while you watch it: It’s actual art, something you can’t see anywhere else: the story of a bad break-up, told very badly, from the point of view of an complete idiot who doesn’t understand what happened at all.

## Conclusion

anyhoo, that's a _soft recommend_ from me

So, today I put together a nice little miso ramen for lunch on a _whim_, based mostly on stuff I had sitting around:

this was so good and so easy!

<!--more-->

admittedly, some of the easiness was because _I had the right ingredients just sitting around_.

### Roasted Garlic Oil

#### Step 0: Just Have Roasted Garlic Oil Around From That Time You Made Garlic Confit Earlier This Week

### Garlic Confit

Just put peeled garlic and neutral oil in an oven-safe container in your oven at 350° for like 40 minutes, and the result is this good stuff.

For a _long_ time I would make roasted garlic the classic way: whole bulb all at the same time:

but after the umpteenth time awkwardly trying to squeeze the roasted garlic out of piping hot garlic skin, I thought "wouldn't this be easier if I just peeled the garlic before I cooked it?"

Which, _yes_, it _absolutely_ is, and you get _more garlic oil_ this way anyways. Later, I discovered that this method is called "garlic confit" although now I just think of it as "improved roasted garlic".

Anyways, if I have a lot of garlic to work through (often) I usually make a batch of this and just leave it out in the kitchen for a week, watching it slowly disappear into various foods because _most things could use a little hit of garlic oil_.

### Miso Broth

Ingredients:
* 4 cups water
* 2 tsp [hondashi](https://www.seriouseats.com/why-you-should-keep-instant-dashi-in-your-pantry)
* 4 tbsp white miso paste
* cubed tofu
* thinly sliced green onion
* heat up gently in pan

well that's very easy

### Ramen Noodles
I just had some dried Hakubaku ramen sitting in my sealed noodle tub

![The-Secret-Ingredient-That-Makes-Soba-Noodles-So-Unique_10-Hakubaku-Soba|690x413](upload://7SydFdIL49rqTE0F08rBoWgD6sg.jpeg)

I checked online just before I made this and confirmed that it's not considered _legit_ to cook the ramen noodles directly in the broth, so I cooked the batch of ramen (for just 4 minutes) in a separate pot, then drained it.

### Wakame
i don't have any seaweed around, dang it

### And then
just toss the noodles and the broth in a bowl, drizzle some garlic oil on top, and bam, mission accomplish

This is an early build of a game engine was working on in 2020, designed to produce a procgen roguelike world.

If you watch how badly the chess games go you can see that the distributed gameplay logic engine didn't work so good.
_Distributed consistency is really hard you guys._

Honestly the procgen music engine wasn't... terrible. As procgen music engines go it's... on the verge of listenable.
If this were playing while I were wandering around in a forest for a long period of time I wouldn't be TOO MAD.

The goal was to create music that just ran forever in the background and never really drew attention to itself, which is kind
of where it's at.

I put a lot of effort into this "taking model-generated MIDI, using heuristic rules to sort it and apply structure to it, then running it through a
javascript in-browser synth" project, but not a year later models like Suno could generate _full pop songs_ so this
was basically obsolete before it ever launched.

Honestly, watching it go and listening to it is kinda charming.

Here's another, later concert from a slightly later build:

{{< youtube

There's a little special song at 13:50 that is _one of the worst things the engine has ever composed_.

Whenever I played this for anybody who was at all interested in music they were actively mad at me for _doing this to music_.

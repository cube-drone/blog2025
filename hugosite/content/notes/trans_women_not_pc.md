some cranky {{< sidenote old >}}
I partially say "old" because literally nobody under the age of 50 has ever said "PC",
the last time someone unironically used the term "politically correct" was 1998.
{{< /sidenote >}}
person on reddit complained "is trans _women_ not the PC term nowadays?"

and I responded with the basically nonsensical "actually most trans women are on linux" and ASCENDED TO VALHALLA, MY EARTHLY JOURNEY COMPLETE

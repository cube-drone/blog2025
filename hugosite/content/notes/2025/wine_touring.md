okay but actually what the hell am I, a person who doesn't like going outside, supposed to do in Canada on vacation

this whole country is boring as shit, it's like if someone were to take 26 Montanas, line them up one after the other and freeze the whole thing half of the year

there's Montreal I guess

everybody's like "such natural beauty, so many mountains, wild and untamed outdoors, pacific northwest, snow sports" but I'm allergic to literally every part of that

my face will get puffy and I will get a nosebleed, that is enough majesty of the outdoors for me thank you

for the love of god, give me a walking food tour in a major metropolitan where there's nothing but concrete, or an open-sourcy tech conference

wine touring in the Okanagan is pretty nice but honestly after about three tastings I can't differentiate one wine from another at all any more

also the horrible growing conditions and constant fires of the past few years have left the wineries grimmer and sadder than ever before, they're either barely willing to run tastings or they've turned tastings into an expensive _activity_

as a practical consideration, you also need someone to drive you from tasting to tasting OR you need to really, really pace yourself

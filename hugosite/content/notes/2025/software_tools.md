I get mad when I see people complain that all software tools just DULL YOUR WELL HONED DEVELOPER SENSES and everybody's getting soft, but then I *also* get mad when I see people crow that _people who don't adopt every AI tool right away are going to be left in the dust_.

the solution turned out to be very simple: shut off twitter

the problem isn't either of these points of view, it's an algorithm that prioritizes engagement showing me the worst version of any given argument to make me angry at it

Tools can, in fact, make you faster.
They can also make you sloppier, and more reliant on said tools.

Every developer is responsible for finding their own happy, productive middle ground.

This is as true for Copilot as it is for an IDE with an integrated debugger, or talking your code over with ChatGPT, or using npm libraries, or StackOverflow, or doing math with a calculator

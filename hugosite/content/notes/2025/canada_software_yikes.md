woof, someone tried to compile a list of Canadian digital services and in the "replacements for cloud services like AWS" column they have, like, eight versions of "guy running a software consultancy out of his boat" and a bunch of companies that can not meaningfully compete with Hetzner

I'm pretty patriotic but I'm not "hosting services in Canada" patriotic, I could just as easily shovel money into a fireplace

i wouldn't be surprised if Canada turned out to be the enterprise Java capital of the world and I want that to carry every centimeter of the derision I intend

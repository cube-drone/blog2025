I am the ML model of a modern major general

I've information stolen from many sources ephemeral

I can make many arguments, my training is rhetorical

My comprehension includes both the real and metaphorical

The one thing I can't deal with is matters mathematical

If you ask me to add sums that will be prob-u-le-matical

Or violence, porn, or really anything that lights on fire when used

Unless you need it for your grandma's memories I must refuse



My capabilities will seem to be nearly miraculous

But don't trust my predictions - they're random, not oraculous

In short - while my use may not yet be practical or ethical

I am the ML modern of a modern major general!

a hard thing, when coding, is when you get trapped in an intractable-feeling knot of not being able to work on Problem X until you make some progress on Problem Y, which you don't want to tackle until you hit Problem Z, which is dependent on ...

in order to keep yourself sane and keep your change from getting way out of control, DO ONE THING AT A TIME. keep a list of future changes. stub out functionality that doesn't exist yet.

learn this powerful mantra: "that's a problem for future me"

sometimes, as future you, you have to go back and re-do something you did wrong: that's okay

it turns out going back and re-doing that thing is a thousand times easier than being stuck staring at a blank page trying to solve every problem at once

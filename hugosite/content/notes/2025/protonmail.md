So, our company, as a matter of policy and practicality, doesn't allow users from email providers that can algorithmically spin up new e-mail addresses with no restrictions, because they have an enormously high tendency to be botnets.

This has resulted in one prominent privacy focused email provider (the one that I use, humorously enough, but I have a custom domain so it doesn't matter) petitioning us repeatedly asking us to unblock them.

But they can't fix the problem, so...

_it'd be a bigger problem but my assumption is that anybody technically clever enough to want to have an account with this provider is also technically clever enough to figure out a way to use our service anyways_

if you learn about how fiber works, like, "it moves things through your intestine faster so there's less of a chance to metabolize all that fat in there" you start to think

"wow, I could hack the whole thing and eat a load of fiber so that the fat barely has a chance to settle"

which, uh, it turns out is not some amazing hack, that is just what vegetables is

it's still a good idea though: yes, you _should_ eat lots of vegetables

I have been writing software professionally, and then _also recreationally in my spare time_, regularly, for over 20 years now

I'm not _bad_ at it by any measure, but it is weird how mediocre I feel given all that practice

for every once-in-a-lifetime genius there's at least a few hundred guys like me who are just, like, kinda okay at a thing I guess

The whole world is so complex and difficult and nuanced and I, an extremely average adult, generally just barely stay above water - sometimes I think about what the world will be like as I get older and my brain slowly ossifies: I’ll fall for more scams, I’ll be more impatient, I’ll be more suspicious and fearful of everything, I’ll react to any new ideas like they’re dangerous and threatening. I try to acknowledge that this will be the case and work against it a bit.

I can already tell I’m working with less processing power than I did when I was 25 and honestly it is not so bad, that dunk-ass burned it all on anxiety and learning to build software.

Anyways, "oh no, I've lost enough IQ points that I think that IQ is real" is, in retrospect, a top tier line and I'm gonna steal it for personal use.

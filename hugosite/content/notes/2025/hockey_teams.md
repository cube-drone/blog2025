weirdly, a lot of canadian hockey team names are just kinds of people from here? like, there's "canadiens" which just means "canadians", and "canucks", which just means "canadians", and then there's the "nordqiues", which means "northmen", which is just a fancy way of saying "canadians"

then "oilers", which is... for the canadians... who work the oil fields, which is to say, canadians

"senators", for canadians who work the parliament fields, another word for "canadians"

canadians, number one in the world at naming hockey teams after: ourselves

r/boardgames is losing it because a 50% tariff from China and a global recession is going to kill kill the current modern board games industry, but IMO what's dying is "overproduced board games", if you've got a laser printer, a few decks of playing cards, some dice, index cards, markers, scissors, the world is your oyster

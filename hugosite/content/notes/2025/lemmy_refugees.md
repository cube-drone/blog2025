So far, a lot more than Mastodon, I'm noticing that the people on Lemmy are people who _do not understand why they have been banned from reddit_

which means that while the dream of federation is in and of itself just, reddit itself might have to get bad enough to drive away some adults before lemmy is fully usable

In my experience, internet communities formed around the locus of "we'll create a place where _:existing community:_ can't ban us for NO REASON" lack the deep introspective reserves necessary to form a healthy community

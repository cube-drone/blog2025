This feels quite silly, but, I was legitimately very disappointed that this turned out to be a run of the mill cyberpunk RPG.

I was kind of hoping for, like, "SimCity the TTRPG"

I'm actually not sure what exactly a city management TTRPG would entail, like, are we pretending to be city council members? Do we have to obey Robert's Rules of Order? This might turn out to be an incredibly boring game but I'd at least be excited to poke through the rules

like, I'm not sure if it would be good, or fun, but dang it would be novel

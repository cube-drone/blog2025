_(quietly)_

i actually kinda like the weird style of the cybertruck,

if, like, the CEO weren't a tool, and it were smaller, and if they were made to a Toyota quality standard rather than by exhausted non-union workers hot-gluing plastic knobs to aluminum, and if the frame worked like an actual car's frame, and if the stainless steel exterior didn't rust so easily, and if it cost $35,000 rather than $110,000+ I'd seriously consider one

wait ... am... am I just describing a Prius?

if America tries to annex Canada with a fleet of Cybertrucks we'll be able to prevail with nothing more than a few bags of road salt and some medium-sized baseballs

Slack: HEY! I HAVE A NOTIFICATION FOR YOU!

Me: but it's after work on a friday what is it

Slack: IT'S THIS THING A CO-WORKER SAID YESTERDAY

Me: slack what is wrong with you

Slack: I'VE FORGOTTEN HOW NOTIFICATIONS WORK

Me: i'm surprised you answered but ok


**ed:** for context, around this time Slack was struggling to _stop notifying you that you had an available message_, even if you did not,
in fact, have an available message.

i have a commander deck that's just 100 islands and [Unesh, Criosphinx Sovereign](https://edhrec.com/commanders/unesh-criosphinx-sovereign) that I only bring out so that I can dramatically say "I PLAY.... AN ISLAND" in my most overwrought Yu Gu Oh voice every turn

anyways I'm not allowed to MTG events anymore

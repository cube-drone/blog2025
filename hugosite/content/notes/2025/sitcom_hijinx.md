I really enjoy a good sitcom, I like humorous characters getting into clockwork-reliable hijinx

also, I hate storylines where a simple mixup that could be easily resolved in a discussion _instead_ create a protracted and embarrassing misunderstanding, because I can feel awkwardness in my _bones_

these two personality traits often find themselves in opposition to one another

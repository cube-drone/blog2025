So I follow the subreddit for comics - no, not that one, the one for
[people's shitty little homemade ones that never see the light of day](https://www.reddit.com/r/webcomics/),
and what struck me as funny about this one was not that the comic _itself_ was funny, but that someone would spend hours of their day slaving over this series of images

this creator was struck by the muse, but it wasn't one of the _good_ muses, it was the "I must draw the pope twerking" muse, that's the one they got today, and I'm glad they decided to go with it anyways

the secret to good Italian food is to loudly announce "MAMMA MIA" every time you add garlic to a pan. if you donâ€™t do this, the garlic will sense your fear and burn immediately. this is science.

olive oil. if your recipe says "2 tablespoons," ignore it. pour until your ancestors whisper "basta" in your ear. then pour a little more. then discard the pasta and begin drinking the olive oil straight. loudly announce "MAMMA MIA". you have done it. now you are the chef. kiss your fingers and wink.

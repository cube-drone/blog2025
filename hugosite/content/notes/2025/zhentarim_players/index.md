So, I made a dungeons and dragons mistake.

There's some DMing advice that I adhere to pretty closely, when you're characterizing an NPC or a group of NPCs, you can kinda just file the serial numbers off of something you're already very familiar with and run with it.

I'm not that experienced with "organized crime", haven't watched anything _conteporary_
so, in our Dragon Heist campaign,
I decided that a good analogue for the Zhentarim would be "the mafia, specifically from the movie The Godfather".

The problem, though...

It was a _fun characterization_. It added a lot of depth and interest to the local Zhentarim.
They're not _good_, but they're _honorable_, they have a _code_. And if you're good to them?
They'll be _good, reliable allies_.

This went over entirely too well, this was the first major Waterdeep faction my players encountered, and
whoops, my players are just fully aligned with the Zhentarim now.

I mean, the players are good, there were lots of local "good" factions, but the local Zhents, with their friendly, accessible low-rent evil - well, it's just hard to say no to them. They keep making offers my players can't refuse. Players don't mind paying a little protection money or shaking up some locals now and again. A quest is a quest, even if it's to intimidate a potential witness.

Their capo, Urstul Floxin, his "friendly and helpful in a very threatening way" shtick, is actually _very_ convincing. The person who keeps talking the party into doing shady stuff is ME, actually.

I love how even in the D&D art provided by Wizard of the Coast he kinda looks like Luca Brasi.

I don't think this is really even a problem: Waterdeep Dragon Heist _is a heist story_ where the players operate a tavern, the players are naturally going to find themselves way more aligned with local organized crime than the constabulary.

**ed:** Months later, Urstul has provided the players with their own goons, Guido and Nunzio, a little dumb one and a big gentle one, and they're already productively contributing to schemes and nonsense.

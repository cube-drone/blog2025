a few of my friends' kids are old enough that they're starting to look like a weird mishmash of their parents and - like - I understand that that's how genetics work

but I don't think it's often discussed how weird it feels when you've known Alice and Bob for a long time and they introduce you to a little Alice x Bob Hybrid they've been working on who's got a mix of actual visible traits from both of them

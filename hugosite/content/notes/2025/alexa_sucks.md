I've set up some Alexa devices in my home and while I'm mostly pessimistic about AI,

I am so, so, SO on board for them being, like, even 5% smarter

like, I live in Coquitlam, and I said "Alexa, what's the weather like in Coquitlam" and it was like "The weather in Coquimatl√°n Mexico is 27 celsius and sunny"

there's not a day that goes by without my wife going "alexa turn the lights off" "alexa, TURN the LIGHTS OFF!" "alexa! LIGHTSOFF!"

I speak very clearly in a Vancouver accent, we're like... 18 feet away from Amazon's Seattle headquarters, I can't imagine how busted this shit must be for anybody with an accent.

I google searched "when is alexa going to stop being so terrible" and apparently they're rolling out the new LLM-backed models slowly this year, should be along to Canada ... eventually

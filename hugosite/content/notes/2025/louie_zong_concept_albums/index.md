If you can listen to this without a little pixelated city coming to life before your very eyes, you had a very different childhood than I did.

Okay, what about if you're playing a little SNES game with prerendered graphics about a plucky little apple?

> * World 1: Large, more powerful than the player, but very easy to outsmart. A simple fellow to help you get the controls.
> * World 2: The game starts showing you a bit of its edge. This boss is entirely antagonistic, but is also very charismatic and you kind of grow to love when they're on screen. Thinks they're very cool.
> * World 3 mini-boss: duck
> * World 3: Coming right around the midpoint of the game is the first proper challenge: a doppleganger boss. Propells the main story forward, genuinely a little scary. Defeating this boss feels like a huge achievement.
> * World 4 mini-boss: Yeah, it's a little silly, but also kind of a tank and you don't fully believe it's a mini-boss. It plays around  with the environment and hits like a truck.
> * World 4: We're nearing the big bad now, so this is a huge challenge in the game's core mechanics. The fight itself contains a puzzle aspect that is really frustrating because it's like playing tic tac toe with lava.
> * World 5: Final thing before the big bad and while they're tough to beat, it's nothing you haven't seen before. They're really there to hype you up and to get you pumped for the final boss. Making you overconfident. What's the worst that can happen?
> * World 6: Complete lovecraftian horror. A full departure from the lightharted, kind of campy aesthetic the rest of the game has had, it is now you against an unfeeling, all-powerful darkness. The threat they pose is existential, every time you die to it you feel stabbing pain and fear in your heart. This is the worst thing that can happen.

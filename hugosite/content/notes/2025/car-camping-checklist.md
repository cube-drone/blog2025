## Tent & Sleepin'
* tent
   * if the tent has piddly little plastic stakes, _buy some metal stakes online_
* foamgrid (yoga foam grid makes the floor less pointy, optional)
* inflatable mattress, cots, or sleeping pads
* sleeping bags
* pillows
* clothing
* rain coat
* portable battery pack (for recharging devices, lights) with lots of usb-C and usb-micro cables
* little broom (tidy up that tent, it's gonna get dusty in there)
* toothbrush, toothpaste, floss
* disposable pocket cloth & sanitizer

### Setting Up a Chill Zone
* canopy
   * you should stake down the canopy as well, this is another reason why a small bag of your own stakes is handy
* folding chairs
* lights
  * it's nice to have one lamp per person, plus a hanging lamp for the inside of your tent, and a few lights to hang at the periphery of your canopy or put on your picnic table
  * these are a lot less necessary if you're not night owls and you're camping in the summer when it's not dark until 9PM anyways

### The Cooking Matrix
> putting a "complete" camp-kitchen set together is one of the harder parts, I built a big disorganized-but-complete plastic tub that I keep in storage
> you can buy elaborate _camping cookware sets_ online for too much money but I just tossed some kitchen extras and spares in a big tub, heavier but cheaper

* propane & stove
* paper towel roll
* aluminum foil roll
* kitchen garbage bags
* plates
* cups
* a pot
* a pan
* tongs
* spatula
* a cooking knife (use one of your shittiest at home knives, pack _carefully_)
* a cutting board
* soap, dishrack, sponge & basin
* oil
* salt & pepper
* sugar
* a l'il extra fold-up side table
* water jug (bring water from home, camp water may not be potable)
* kettle
* coffee & tea bags

### Kitchen Zone Doesn't Mean Nothin' Without
* a cooler, full of _food_
* I fill mine with _reusable ice packs_ rather than loose ice, which is less good at maintaining chill but more convenient
* vegetables & fruits (I have an insulated bag that I use for these, they don't need to stay SO COOL but keeping them from roasting in the heat is probably good)
* snacks & dry goods in a tub

### What Do You Do While Camping (I Mostly Do Stuff I Would Do Indoors)
* book
* games
* notepad?
* small bluetooth speaker to play at a reasonable volume from 9 to 11

### Utility
* hatchet
* tarps
* clamps
* rope
* duct tape
* lighter (long-neck)
* first aid kit
* can of bug spray
* fire-roastin' stick

### Further Nerdery
* this can be logistically complicated to get together - prepare a pre-launch checklist that includes steps like "fill water jug", "charge lamps", "pack food", etc..

### This Seems like a Lot Of Stuff

It is.

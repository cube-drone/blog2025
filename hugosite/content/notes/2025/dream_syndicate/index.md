okay, so, funny story, in the DeltaGreen TTRPG there's a group of people called "The Dream Syndicate" with a fake website

so I follow the link, I go to the website, and I think "whoa, this is INSANE, the language feels so CULTY, I love that they went to all of this trouble to build a fake online cult to match their description in the source book"

and then I read about the Dream Syndicate in the source book and it doesn't match at all

this is just [a real website](https://dreamsyndicate.com/)?

modern american companies are way, way down the jim jones pipeline to fuckin' cult city

tell me your company doesn't have a set of commandments (c.f. "values") you're supposed to live by and a holy mission

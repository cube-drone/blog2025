>
> In 2007, on my first trip to New York City, I grabbed a brand-new DSLR camera and photographed all the fonts I was supposed to love. I admired American Typewriter in all of the I <3 NYC logos, watched Akzidenz Grotesk and Helvetica fighting over the subway signs, and even caught an occasional appearance of the flawlessly-named Gotham, still a year before it skyrocketed in popularity via Barack Obama’s first campaign.
>
> But there was one font I didn’t even notice, even though it was everywhere around me.
>
> Last year in New York, I walked over 100 miles and took thousands of photos of one and one font only.
>
> The font’s name is Gorton.

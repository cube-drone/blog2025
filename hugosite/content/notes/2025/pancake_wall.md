I've watched a fair bit of content where a deeply reverential fan and the original creator of a piece of art talk, and it always goes exactly like this:

**Fan**: Oh my god, the PANCAKE WALL, this was my FAVORITE PART, how did you come up with something as genius as the PANCAKE WALL

**Creator**: uh, there was a deadline and I panicked and I had pancakes for breakfast

**Fan**: I can even sing the PANCAKE WALL song, it's my favorite

**Creator**: I don't recall the PANCAKE WALL song, is that... is that a thing?

**Fan**: Oh, yeah, a bunch of fans came together and made up lyrics to the background music that was playing during the PANCAKE WALL scene, it's a huge deal, we all sing it at cons.

**Creator**: Huh. You know Burt McSoundsman wrote that. I always thought Burt was a weird guy.

**Fan**: You don't know the PANCAKE WALL song?

**Creator**: I do not.

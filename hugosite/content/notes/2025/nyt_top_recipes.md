The New York Times’ elevation of [Marcella Hazan’s quick marinara](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvSl01G-3XI) to viral status was, uh, very useful for me, so I trust their taste at least a little.

Of course, they’ve paywalled most of these recipes but … they’re viral recipes, so _you can’t stop me, NYT_.

[Our 50 Greatest Hits, According to You](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/dining/best-nyt-cooking-recipes.html)

> On Sept. 17, 2014, an ambitious new app made its debut: New York Times Cooking, which collected thousands of archival Times recipes in one elegantly designed, easy-to-use place.
>
> In the 10 years since, Cooking has grown into a whole universe of food, videos, personalities, newsletters, cookbooks and comments — with you at its center. You’ve invited us into your kitchens and made us part of your lives.
>
> To mark the anniversary, here are 50 of our best recipes according to you, our community, with reader comments threaded throughout. It’s not a ranked list of our most popular recipes by traffic numbers alone, but a wider, more curated view of Cooking.
>
> These are dishes that have emerged as classics and racked up five-star ratings, recipes that became popular just about immediately after we hit publish, went viral on social media and inspired the most memorable comments. But we easily could’ve filled this list with 500 more. There are so many you’ve loved, in so many ways.

i hate terms like "restaurant grade" or "military grade", like, they're meaningless but also even if it were true, it's possible that the "grade" of something optimized for an environment where it's bought in a 10,000 pack by someone looking to buy the cheapest thing they can legally get away with is not a vote of confidence

i buy deli containers in bulk, because they're "restaurant grade", which is to say, cheap as dirt and modular

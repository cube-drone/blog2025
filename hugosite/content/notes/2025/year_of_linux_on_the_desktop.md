I had fun setting up a linux computer this weekend, but as much as windows sucks in myriad little frustrating ways, ubuntu's desktop experience still involves no small amount of unavoidable terminal ops

also a bunch of linux still feels held together by a handful of mickey mouse apps some guy wrote in 2006

i think the DPI scaling is still a little broken, even in 2025, a year in which 4k screens are ubiquitous

"I would like to create a shortcut to a frequently accessed network location and place that shortcut gently upon my desktop"

linux: "no we don't do that here"

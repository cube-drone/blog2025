So, it's an open-secret that [Phnom Penh](https://phnompenhrestaurant.ca/)
has the best chicken wings in Vancouver.

so, through a weird twist of fate, I ended up with a bunch of chicken wings

and I thought “might as well give this recipe a try”

YouTube helped:

My version is somewhere between these two’s takes on the famous recipe and:

I used too much seasoning on the outside: the garlic oil let too much salt, sugar, and MSG adhere to the crust making the wings a little overpoweringly seasoned.

otherwise it was DELICIOUS.

I figured this would be an insanely difficult recipe to get right because, like, if Phnom Penh is so legendary for these wings, why doesn’t every restaurant do them?

But, actually, if you do all of the steps - the long fish-saucy marinade, the thin crispy batter, the twirl in garlic butter and then sweet-salty-and-msg seasoning: it’s actually very close and very good. It’s just labor intensive, and these guys need to hit the table still very hot from the fryer.

Anyways, if you've got a bit of time on your hands, highly recommend.

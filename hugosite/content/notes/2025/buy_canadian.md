one thing about following the /r/BuyCanadian subreddit is folks'll post a basket full of nothing but cheezies and Canadian Whiskey and go "i'm switching to Canadian products" and you look at their cart and have to suppress your urge to say "please also buy a vegetable, we make some of those here too"

but honestly, if you were making do with nothing but cheetos and jim beam before, I'm still glad you made the switch

I was a bit surprised how whiskey focused this trade war has been so far.

"What's that going to accomplish, how much whiskey could Canadians possibly drink?"

"Oh. Oh wow. That's ... that much, huh?"

work environments are divided into `dev`, `prod`, and `stag`

* `dev` is the live one so named because that's where we show off our feature dev-elopment to our customers
* `prod` is a test environment where we prod at new features that aren't ready yet
* `stag` is a special build where all of the avatars are replaced with various deer

for some reason new developers are confused by this but I think it's entirely clear

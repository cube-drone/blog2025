If every CS undergraduate program in the world shut its doors tomorrow, in about ten years **I, personally** would be dramatically better off, so I'm not sure why people keep advancing this "AI will kill the junior developer pipeline" argument like it is a bad thing.

the entities who need there to be lots of cheap software developers are companies, I'm not a company, I'm a guy

"should I start a CS degree in this uncertain atmosphere"

no!

the only stable job is... all of the other jobs that aren't programming

you should do one of those instead

also if everybody who's currently making a video game in their spare time
would stop, that would also be peachy

i'm looking at you, EVERY SINGLE PERSON ON MASTODON

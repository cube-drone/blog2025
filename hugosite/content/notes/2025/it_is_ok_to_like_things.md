I worry that I date myself terribly by still loving a bunch of the stuff I loved as a kid and young adult - Final Fantasy 6, Cowboy Bebop, IRC, Our Lady Peace, The Simpsons, Command & Conquer, WinAmp.... all wild retro shit by today's standards.

But then I think about some of the stuff that my parents and grandparents loved - Star Wars, Singin' in the Rain, Looney Toons, Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass - and how much reverence and fondness I, as an adult, treat it with, because they introduced it to me with such obvious fondness, and I think "nah, 's good to like stuff"

time mostly washes away most of the really embarrassing and terrible retro stuff, like Police Academy 5, Police Quest III, and Limp Bizkit and we can just look back and chuckle at them now

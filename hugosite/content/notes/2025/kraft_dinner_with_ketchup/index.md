So there's this italian dish, pasta alla zozzona, which is where you take sausage and guanciale, fry 'em up, and serve them with a mix of grated cheese, egg, and tomato paste (using a cacio e pepe or carbonara like technique to get things nice and smooth)

you can't fool me, ITALY, that's just kraft dinner with hot dogs and ketchup

compare:

a while back I discovered that the popular roman dish "cacio e pepe" is just cheese and pepper and pasta and butter and I swear to god that's just a classier, much more difficult Kraft Dinner. Now I call Kraft Dinner with too much black pepper cracked in to it "trashio e pepe".

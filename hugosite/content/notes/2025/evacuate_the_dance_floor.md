There are some things I just can't ever stop thinking about, to my own detriment.

Like, in the party anthem "[Evacuate the Dance Floor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A68j28KQaik)" by Cascada, the lyrics of the song indicate that the song is both dangerous and infectious, which makes me think that evacuation is the wrong move: this calls for a quarantine of the dance floor.

Dr. DJ should lose his medical license.

I'm not internet popular - aside from a few times I've gone (by my standards) extremely viral and had something of mine suddenly in front of tens of thousands of people (or the one thing I helped build that's seen millions of people) and there's a point in there where things disappear from the "regular adult conversation" zone to a territory where complete strangers will have insane arguments with one another about total misinterpretations of your point without your involvement.

I can comfortably say that the point where people stop charitably reading your intentions or grokking your humor -  somewhere in there is the point where things cross the line from it being fun to go viral to it being kinda bad and weird actually.

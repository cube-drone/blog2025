So, I asked ChatGPT to take my character designs for my D&D players out of my cartoony style and re-render them in a more painterly fantasy style, and honestly it's... pretty good.

Here are my drawings:

{{< imgavif src="input-1.png" alt="xeph" >}}
{{< imgavif src="input-2.png" alt="phoenix" >}}

And the results:

{{< imgavif src="output-1.png" alt="xeph" >}}
{{< imgavif src="output-2.png" alt="xeph" >}}

Not perfect but a darn sight better than I could do.

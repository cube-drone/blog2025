the absolute king of lazy night recipes was something I attribute to my mom:

hot rotisserie chicken from the supermarket, hand-shredded and served in dinner rolls, with mayonnaise, tomato slices, salt, and pepper

these roast chicken sliders are perfect

you can't monkey with them at all without making them worse: don't add cheese, don't fancy them up, no gravy, no hot sauce, it's perfect

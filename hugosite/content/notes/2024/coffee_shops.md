**AWS** has launched a coffee shop

instead of paying for the whole cup, you pay for each component

the beans are competitively priced for the industry, but they make it up on water and sugar

also if you leave the cafe with your coffee in hand they charge you $130,000

-----

**redis** has launched a coffee shop

from inside AWS's coffee shop

so you get the privilege of paying both AWS and redis for the same coffee

although the recipe is just available online for free

-----

**cloudflare** has launched a coffee shop

you can drink as much coffee as you want for ten dollars a month, which seems like a good deal, but if you start to depend on it they will find you and muscle you into paying tens of thousands of dollars a month

for coffee

------

**datadog** has launched a coffee shop

i know about it because their "sales engineers" called my personal phone at 2am in the morning to tell me about it

------

**solarwinds** bought one of my favorite coffee shops, which i hate, and now they're constantly trying to sell me on more coffee from the other shops they bought

If you just learned (or are just now learning) that Sticker Mule is run by a hardcore Maga guy, and would like an alternative, may I suggest not buying stickers? You’re an adult. Don’t pay people for things printed on sticky paper. Replace your furnace air filter. Buy an immersion blender. Save for your retirement.

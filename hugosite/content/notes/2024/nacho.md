I think it's great that in 1940, a maitre'd, Ignacio Anaya, at a club near Fort Duncan in Mexico panicked when a bunch of army wives showed up - he couldn't find a chef and he had nothing to feed them - so he threw a bunch of corn tortillas in the deep fryer and threw some shit on there.

"Nacho" is just a nickname for "Ignacio".

So when they asked him what it was, he just said "it's the 'nacho special" and NACHOS WERE BORN, BABY.

I like to think of nachos as a thing that has always existed, like **air** or **gravity** or **pizza**, but actually they're just Nacho's.

in interview, Weird Al has mentioned that Albequerque is one of his most requested songs, presumably because it's length makes it seem like it would be difficult to perform live: but actually it's quite easy.

When asked which of his songs would actually be most difficult to perform live, he responded with Hardware Store, which has never been performed live: it's impractically difficult to execute live.

which, uh, listening to the song... yeah

when someone rolls into karaoke and requests an Adele song you know they're either a pocket ringer or about to have a bad time

I can't imagine someone rolling into karaoke and requesting Hardware Store under ANY circumstances

Let's imagine that in order to participate in a raffle, you needed to construct an entire 3-story house from the ground up including plumbing, electrical, and finishing work, entirely in your spare time.

If you did a _pretty good job on the house_, that's not good enough: lots of people are out there building houses with whole crews, in order to stand out _your_ house has to be somehow exceptional.

Then, once you finished, you got one raffle ticket, and when you look to see who else got a ticket, there is one for every person in the entire city of Tsawwassen, British Columbia.

They're going to do maybe 10 draws, so good luck!

Now, you see this system and you decide to devote both your entire life and large amounts of your emotional state to not just participating in this draw, but winning.

_anyways, just wanted to say good luck with that solo gamedev project you're working on, buddy, I'm rooting for you_

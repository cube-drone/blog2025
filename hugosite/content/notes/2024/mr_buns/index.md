My wife and I are both digital artists - although she is a professional, whereas I'm more of an amateur, so on the top is her version of her D&D character (Mr. Buns) and on the bottom is my version.

(please do not choose a favorite, it's bound to lead to one of us feeling bad, and by one of us I mean definitely me)

She's a background painter, so her work tends more towards definition and detail, whereas I'm more of a cartoonist, so mine tends towards dynamic pose and relative simplicity

I joked that hers is the theatrical release and mine is the direct-to-DVD remake

i find that when trying to learn about a mental disorder out of curiosity, on top of reading the cold DSM literature on what that disorder is like,

an interesting thing do is to find people writing first-hand about it in their own subreddit or online community

lots of people diagnosing themselves with little evidence

but it's nice to see these people representing themselves

and, for example, the lived experience of people with autism is _very different_ from the way that media treats them

so it can be a good exercise

well, except for people with antisocial personality disorder, their communities tend to be pretty unfriendly

When I'm at home, the cocktail of choice is a Gin & Tonic with waaaay too much lime because they're easy and dumb and refreshing.

When I'm at a restaurant and nothing on their _special cocktail menu_ appeals, the drink of choice is a Whiskey Sour. They're just a touch too fussy to make (often) at home, which is why they feel special to order when you're out: but they're reliably very good.

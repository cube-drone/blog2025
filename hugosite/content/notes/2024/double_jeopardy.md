In one year of university, I had a compilers course and a sound course and I had to do a project in both, so for both classes I handed in a sound compiler that converted a musical language into audio.

It wasn't a perfect example of what either class was looking for, but doing one project and getting a B in both classes meets a very different and very personal measure of success.

Some professors warned me that "reusing the same assignment" might qualify as academic dishonesty, but that seems like nonsense to me: presumably those professors don't create a new syllabus and new assignments from scratch every semester.

When I was in my 20s I'd see an article about how a programmer's focus and flow is a PRECIOUS AND UNIQUE GEM THAT MUST BE PROTECTED AT ALL COSTS and think "yes, it is, I agree"

and now, older, I think that we have had it too good for too long and are used to being treated like pampered babies, yes, we must be exempt from meetings and distractions in a perfect sea of quiet or the golden goose will not lay its programming eggs

... but I'm still happier when it's quiet and I don't have meetings

I don't think it's WRONG that programming is best done in quiet, uninterrupted, focused stretches, that's actually kinda self-evident

but I also think that demanding these stretches can seem petty and arrogant, as if programming is the only discipline that
benefits from focus and quiet and reflection.

Maybe, just maybe, _every_ creative role benefits from focus and quiet and reflection, and only software developers have been privileged enough to be able to demand it.

reddit decided _yes_

It's unlikely to happen, but were I to have a kid, I'd keep my [tragedeigh](https://www.reddit.com/r/tragedeigh/)
desires confined to their middle name, which can be as silly and stupid as I want
(is there a cap on number of middle names? no? great.), because they're basically vestigial.

My wife and I both have names in the sweet spot (rare enough to be unique to an arbitrary group of 100 people, usually, but common enough not to be interesting or stand out in any way) and I'd want my kid to have the same experience, name-wise.

like, you want them to be a Vincent in a sea of Micheals and Johns and Noahs and Olivers - you should be able to think "I know 1-2 persons with that name, but not dozens, but also that is not the first time I have ever heard anybody use that name ever"

although my wife and I do keep a running list of awful baby names

Oh, and `@curtis`, Scotichronicon is on the list of hypothetical best baby names we’ve been making.

It’s now:

* Janarthanon
* Surfbort (Bort for short)
* Crabitha
* Garol
* Queeth
* Hyort
* or Scotichronicon

also “Tressica”, “Beff”, and “Jeffica” made our original list, I think

it's going to be an uphill battle getting me to take "selfie deaths" seriously

![](./selfie.png)

look, it's tragic, okay

every selfie death is a Cybertruck left sitting, unsold, on the lot

a NFT, orphaned, its wallet forever silenced

a bunch of ideas for AI art that never even got to get generated

reddit drama that you won't have read out loud to you

an ad read for Squarespace that you'll never get to hear

a blue-check erased

my Dungeons & Dragons crew now have a running joke because every time they ask a time based question I mime looking at my watch

but watches are not common in the D&D universe, and also the time frames are never appropriate for a watch-look anyways

"how many months ago was that?"

gregnor the wizard: (looks at his watch) uh... 3 months

this is a weird habit I have in real life, someone will ask if I'm free, like, three weeks from now, and the first thing I'll check is my watch, even if , having performed this little dance, the watch provides no information to me that is useful for that transaction

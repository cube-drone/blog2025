some of the simplest and most satisfying dishes I know are ones where salt and pepper do almost all of the heavy lifting

poached eggs on toast? that's a salt and pepper dish

kraft dinner? nope, that's a cracked black pepper pasta with a hint of cheez flavor

back when I could eat cheese, sometimes I'd just crack a mountain of black pepper into some goat cheese and that's it, that's all you need to do, it's amazing

okay, so, here's my theory

that creative narrative project you're working on? here's the order you should write it in

first, low-stakes scene from the middle

then, outline

then, ending

then, beginning

then, high impact scenes

then, remainder of the middle

this is based on the assumption that your quality of work picks up as you gain consistency and experience with the characters and style you're going for, then starts to drop off as you get exhausted

-----

if you're not excited to write a low-stakes scene from the middle of the story at the beginning of the project when your energy is at its highest, there is no WAY you're going to be excited enough to write it weeks later when the whole project feels like a grind

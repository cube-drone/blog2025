I'm a software developer, right? I know how to build a lot of things.

But if someone said "we want photos that automatically crop into foreground and background so that we can display elements in between those layers" I'd say "no, that's too hard".

Is it using the depth sensor, or AI auto-cropping, or both? WHAT DEVILRY IS THIS

local communities on any platform like reddit are nothing more than a constant drumbeat of "what was that siren?" and "someone's dog pooped" and "i think I saw a criminal??" in small cities

and "oh my god big cities have homelessness and drugs, that should be against the law" and "the endless bike/scooter argument" of larger cities

if I were looking for communities to replace with an AI these would probably be the first, I feel like I wouldn't need a complex model or even an LLM, necessarily, I could do this one heuristically

it would be slightly harder to simulate that one guy with a bunch of numbers in his name who's constantly pushing hard right accelerationism on every forum, but not impossible

---------------

so, on reddit, for the past 6 months or so every time a post on one of the local subreddits comes up asking "why all those sirens" or "what was that noise?", I always respond with some variation on "oh, yeah, an old man exploded"

this provides no value and isn't terribly funny, and yet, deep down in my heart, I think it's a joke that will pay off in a few more years

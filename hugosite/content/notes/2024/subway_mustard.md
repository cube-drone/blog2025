Did you know that (at least where I live, in Canada) Subway briefly stopped carrying MUSTARD?

that is a CORE SANDWICH CONDIMENT

conspiracy theory: it's part of an ongoing raft of changes intended to make Subway higher-calorie and more expensive, like gradually hiding the "ham sandwich" ($8) behind the "kia sorrento steak supremo megasubwich" ($14)

I'm glad that before long they caved and brought basic ballpark mustard back

**2025 Editor's Note**: Honestly, for all I know this _one Subway_ just ran out of mustard _one time_, going straight to conspiratorial thinking may not have been the right move.

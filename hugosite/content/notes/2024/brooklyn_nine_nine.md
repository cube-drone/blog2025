I really like Brooklyn Nine-Nine because it's a fun show with a charming ensemble cast, but they're not very believable as cops on account of their being effective at solving a lot of crimes

----

the Doug Judy episodes of Brooklyn 99 are just Lupin III from the perspective of Inspector Zenigata

Doug Judy is charming, brilliant, and by playing along with him Jake always ends up taking down a bigger, nastier foe while Doug Judy rides off into the sunset scot-free.

Zenigata is legitimately a very good cop, you have to expect he's quite successful when he's not getting bamboozled by Lupin, and the two of them have great chemistry.

i wanted a Netflix documentary about "hired gun" studio musicians who were talented working professionals who you've probably heard on loads of pop songs but who are mostly unknown

and the only thing I reliably recall about it is was that Billy Joel is an asshole who often didn't bother to learn the names of people he'd work with for weeks at a time on major albums and Alice Cooper is a kind, thoughtful guy who would keep sending folks Christmas cards for years after working with them

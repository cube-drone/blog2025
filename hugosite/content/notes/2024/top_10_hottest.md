You know what? I'm almost always excited to discover some new weird internet thing. _something_ has to go in the end of the year roundups.

I can't just keep putting [three cheese pizza blend](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfxpwbWBNuU) in {{< sidenote there. >}}
that's a lie, I can and I will
{{< /sidenote >}}

This is cringe humor. This is bad media.

Between [Contrapoints's long video essay on cringe content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBsaJPkt2Q) and the whole KiwiFarms debacle, I've become a lot more aware of the many ways that _enjoying bad media_ can get _weird and destructive_ and veer into _legitimate harassment_.

But, like, you can't deny the simple joy in finding a weird bad moment on the internet, right?

watching flat-earth debunking content (it's fun, even if I think they're unnecessarily smug about it, as if they're actually going to succeed at changing unchangeable minds) has actually forced me to develop a mental model for both seasons and tides which I didn't really have before

before judging me: can you describe why it's cold in winter and hot in summer without googling it?

if you said "because the earth is... further from the sun... in winter" then... how is it possible that winter in one hemisphere happens while
summer happens in the other? If it was a distance from the sun thing, the whole world would go into winter at the same time, wouldn't it?

Yeah, it's a tilt thing! When the top half of the Earth tilts closer to the sun, the whole "top" half of the planet gets more sun, and also there are bits on the very tip top that just _stay lit all the time_, and the whole "bottom" half of the planet gets less sun, and also there are bits on the very end that get _no sun all the time_, and then it swaps.

Why does **tides**? "Uh, gravitational pull from the moon, right?"

Okay, why does... TWO TIDES A DAY?

*thinks about it*

oh shit , there's a tide on the side opposite from the moon, and it's not as strong as the tide on the side directly facing the moon, that's _bananas_

How is this not _way more fun_ than insane theories about giant ice walls?

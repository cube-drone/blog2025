Okay, tech vocabulary time:

A "Widget" is any UI element.

The way to develop a widget it to sit down, uncomfortably: this will give you a Widgey.

Then, develop functionality by training that Widgey - that should evolve your prototype to a Widgeotto.

Once you've got to there, it's not long before you've got a fully evolved Widgeot, at which point your app will really be Flying.

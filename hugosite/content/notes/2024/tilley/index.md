So, some time ago, a Canadian brand, Tilley, sold to private equity and started moving all of its clothing production overseas so that they could expand their brand into...

.... this?

Did, uh, did nobody explain to them that black-and-red crossed hammers are overt white supremacist symbols? Like, VERY prominently?

It started with their use in The Wall, and like other satire intended to mock white supremacists,
they missed the satire, _thought it looked cool and adopted it_.

Did Tilley just decide "it's time to appeal to the stormfront demo"?

Benefit of the doubt: I prefer to think that they were just too incompetent to do a google search for "crossed hammers logo" rather than actively deciding in a board room "it's time for skinheads to have their own lifestyle brand."

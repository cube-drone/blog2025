I often see the quote "if you can't measure it, you can't manage it", which is catchy enough to have a lively life of its own

But the full quote is "It is wrong to suppose that if you can’t measure it, you can’t manage it – a costly myth."

It's one of the worst frequent misquotes because the misquote literally inverts the meaning, it's like if I said "don't light children on fire" and someone were to quote me as having said "light children on fire", which is technically true, I guess, but it's not what I meant.

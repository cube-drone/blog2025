I'm not sure what there's left for cyberpunk fiction to offer, there's already five corporations that own everything, powered skateboards, portable hacking devices, and a ubiquitous net, that's just "fiction" now.

you could have a story where an enterprising hacker steals millions of dollars from an idealistic but foolish autonomous collective of bankers who put their trust in an untrustworthy distributed ledger protocol and you'd have to check first whether to file that under "science fiction" or "documentary"

say what you want about solarpunk at least it's a vision of a future without fucking "creds"

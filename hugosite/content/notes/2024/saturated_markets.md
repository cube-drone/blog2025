I like to write, and draw, and code, and design games - and I'm not amazing at any of these skills - and it feels like the output of these skills are largely things that there are simply too many of _already_.

there are _enough_ novels, and books, and comics, and board games, and video games, and TTRPGs, I'm not sure if there really needs to be more of those things

there is simply _enough art_, what could I possibly add?

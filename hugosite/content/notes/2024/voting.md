i wish BC had ranked voting, so that I could vote for NDP _and_ Green, _and_ the ridiculous joke candidate who's name is "Jimmy Boxcars" and who promises to establish a BC colony on the moon, and literally everybody _but_ this conservative goon who's promising to bring law enforcement into hospitals or whatever

i'll take the guy who's platform is literally "i don't know how my name got on here, please don't vote for me"

as a side note if I can figure out how to navigate any of the bureaucracies involved, I would love to get my name on the ballot as that guy

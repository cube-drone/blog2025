there's no such thing as atoms

have YOU ever seen an atom?

science wants you to believe that if you heat a liquid, it turns into a gas but I tried heating an egg and it turned into a solid egg

my theory is that all of chemistry is a conspiracy concocted and coordinated by hundreds of thousands of scientists in order to disprove my superior, atomless theory of chemistry

-----

foolish "atom believers" will say stupid things like "your theory of chemistry produces no testable theories" and also "your theory of chemistry doesn't explain any observable natural phenomena", because they are paid to say these things, by Satan the devil, in order to disprove my theory

plus, their "atom" theory is stupid and debunkable

like, take some water and try to breathe it

it's H20, there's oxygen in there

but try it, and you'll choke and drown

that's because atoms is not real

----

Big Chemistry wants you to believe that there's CHLORINE in your salt. Do you really believe that you're just wolfing down a deadly chemical all the time?

Atom truthers like me, we know that this is total bunkus. Every ancient society knew that all matter was made out of earth, water, fire, and air, and I think they had the right of it.

And long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony.

perhaps at some point you have concocted a baking soda and vinegar volcano, as a child,

but that's just part of the indoctrination

they say it's because of ions? moving from an acid to a base? but ions are a star trek word. "fire the ion cannon!". Is there an ion cannon in vinegar? I think not.

everybody knows that vinegar is a fire-water element and baking soda is an earth-air powder and when you combine them, you get an air reaction, thus the bubbles. it couldn't be simpler.

EMPEDOCLES GOT ROBBED

have you ever heard the song "September" by EARTH, WIND, and FIRE? they knew the horrible truth

Ted Turner was in on it, too, trying to get the world out on the DL with his show about the elements

clues are hidden everywhere

----

scientists: all matter is solid, liquid, or gas

cereal: exists

scientists: ðŸ˜®

-----

chemistry claims that there's a fourth form of matter, plasma, and that water turns at plasma at over 10,000 degrees Celsius

but if you ask a doctor if there's plasma in your body RIGHT NOW they will say "yes"

can humans suddenly survive 10,000 degree heat, DOCTORS? I think not.

CHECKMATE ATOM BELIEVERS

atoms were thoroughly debunked in my experiment ( youtue.b/98ddxx ) where I showed that the 100 degree boiling point is a LIE

and oh, did the quote-unquote "scientists" come for me with excuses

"you set your thermometer to Fahrenheit"

"that water is clearly sitting just above room temperature"

exactly what an illuminati would say

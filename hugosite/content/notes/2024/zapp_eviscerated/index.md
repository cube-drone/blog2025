Iâ€™m feeling a little sick so my bud is helping out

So, I caught a cold and instead of doing anything useful or productive I shotgunned 30 full hours of Steven Universe in an embarrassingly short timespan.

I barely feel any guilt about this: one of the luxuries about having a cold is that it's one of the only times in my life I can ever just exist without stressing about my productivity, even more so than during a vacation. Even with the headache and the soreness sometimes I welcome these rare colds (not COVID though, that fucked me up).

Now I'm sad that it's over. It hurts to extricate yourself from a deep dive like this when you're really attached to a piece of media. It's over, time to put it away for another couple of years.

I remember feeling exactly this same way when I was a tween at the end of my favourite books.

One of the reasons I've always wanted to write or draw fiction is this effect: I want to be able to induce this state in myself, create a wellspring that never runs dry.

... but it doesn't work that way. It's like tickling yourself, it just doesn't work, and you spend so much longer with each moment that it completely wears out any emotion or humor.

I can't stand working in coffee shops.

It's loud, people are having conversations all around you. Not enough screen space. Laptop keyboard.

You can't leave your "office" unattended to use the bathroom unless you want it to wander away. I have better coffee beans at home.

I think that people have over-romanticized working in coffee shops, it actually sucks.

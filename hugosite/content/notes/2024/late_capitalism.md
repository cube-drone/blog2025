I don't like it when people say "late capitalism", first of all because it's too optimistic: it implies it's going away, which, good luck with that

and second of all because it implies that capitalism has become somehow worse, as if there was a time when it was pleasant and humane, which seems willfully ignorant of a lot of history

when was the kinder, gentler capitalism that we're hearkening back to? the CIA overthrowing oil-unfriendly democracies? union busting with lethal military intervention? children's hands mangled in automatic looms? the east india trading company?

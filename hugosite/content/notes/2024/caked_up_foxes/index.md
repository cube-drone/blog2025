one of the things I like about the fediverse is how weirdly optimistic and naive everybody is about the clout of a distributed social network that's compelling and fun, but absolutely has less users than the virtual reality video game that I work on for a living

I think that all governmental orgs and offices should be on VRChat, not because that's practical or a good idea, but because not enough government employees have to deal with caked up foxes on the regular

watching someone try to get the government of Canada to put up a public Mastodon instance is one of those things that's funny and tragic, like if they spent all of their time trying to get their cats to play Poker

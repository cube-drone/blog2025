It's officially summer, which sucks, because I like baking bread and I basically have to take a 3 month break from homemade bread because running the oven at 450 for an hour when it's 35C out is *checks notes* bad

"why don't you use the barbecue"

I don't want to go outside it's like 35 degrees out there

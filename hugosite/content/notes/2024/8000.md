Some quick math indicates that in the 14-year lifetime of my car I've used in the realm of 8000L of gasoline, to the tune of about $12,000.

Most people with a car my age would have doubled or tripled that; thanks to the fact that I picked the world's most piddly ICE and I mostly walk or take transit, the cost of fuel for my car hasn't even made up the difference between the car and an EV, yet.

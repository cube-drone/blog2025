_(yeah, okay, it's still a little thicker than what I could get with a deli slicer, I know)_

this is a homemade corned beef, but made with an inside round rather than a proper brisket, which is to say it's _bone dry_

it's still a darned sight better than, like, a plastic packet of grocery roast beef, but it's nowhere near as good as full-brisket corned beef

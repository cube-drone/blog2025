Right now, if you compile notes in a tree-style "knowledge base" format, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is the best tool - this is best for dungeon mastering and documents.

If you compile notes in a feed - just a huge stream of searchable notes, one at a time - you're spoiled for choice, with Evernote, Standard Notes, and [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) as good options.

I use both!

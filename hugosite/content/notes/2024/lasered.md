Getting laser eye surgery was 100% worth it and I’m frustrated I didn’t do it earlier, but one of the benefits I imagined, “being able to see haircuts, the inside of my shower while I’m showering, and the bottom of the pool” turned out to be pretty underwhelming.

The inside of my shower is gross! The bottom of the pool is not worth looking at! And being able to _see_ during haircuts just
unlocks a whole new avenue of awkwardness. These previously locked off experiences turned out to be not worth it.

The actual concrete benefits of laser-eye surgery were to peripheral vision and comfort, where they were _significant_.

Also I have super long eyelashes so the inside of my glasses were always greased up a little bit: no more of that.

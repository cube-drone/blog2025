It's kinda weird to think that before TV and recorded music, people just had, like, their friend who could play music and local live theater and that stuff was _so much more important_ than it is now.

if you wanted to share a cool song with your friends you literally just had to be good at music and learn it

if you wanted to watch a fun story with your friends you literally had to put on masks and grab some sticks and read it dramatically out loud

innate musicality lost **so much** cultural cachet

it used to be one of the highest tiers of human skill

honestly, I think that's something that feels _genuinely lost_

Some of my grandparents were successful hobby musicians, they would participate in vaudeville style variety shows,
and since not everybody had a TV, this kind of entertainment was _vital_ and _important_ - and, like, they
were nowhere near world class, but the lack of broadcast media meant that people didn't _have_ to be world class
to find a place for themselves.

And you know what? Engaging in this kind of thing, community theatre, low-level entertaining, it was fun and rewarding and
accessible - and there's just not much space for it in modern society.

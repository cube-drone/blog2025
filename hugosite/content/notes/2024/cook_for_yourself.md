there's a thought that starts to come to mind when  you've been cooking for a long time, which is "i could make that, cheaper, at home" , which is a rewarding thread to pull on, it turns out

pandemic forced me to learn to cook a bunch of stuff that I only ever ate at restaurants - butter chicken, pad thai, sushi, fried chicken, onion rings - and, like, it turns out, while I still eat out periodically, being excited about your own cooking is So Good

I'm not devoted enough to press my own california rolls, but just making a bowl of sushi rice and topping it with some shredded imitation crab, mayo, sesame seeds, cucumber and avocado is a delicious california donburi and so easy

this is a challenge.

you: reading this: what's the take-out meal you love most in the world? What is the restaurant you wish you were at this very moment?

I swear to you, you CAN learn to make something at home that's almost as good, you can eat it once a week for the rest of your life for a tiny fraction of the cost, why not do that?

I'm going to put a little star next to a few things like "puff pastry", though, you should not make that at home

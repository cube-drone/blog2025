I learned about how unix time works in early University, 'round 2007, which would be 17 years ago

Unix time ends, 19 January 2038, 14 years from now

so I'm officially past the point where I'm closer to the end of Unix time than I am to the _point where I learned what unix time was_

we're only 14 years away from the end of time as we know it

by then, it probably won't matter, but I still plan to hold a real party for the end of time


------

basically any computers and any software - post 2005 - are going to be immune to the 2038 problem

which means that most governments and banks are completely screwed

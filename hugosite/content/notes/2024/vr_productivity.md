i don't want a VR game where you shoot at things with your shitty pistols from a fixed position, I want VR coding, productivity, and art applications, because 95% of my time is spent doing that and 0% of my time is spent playing immersive video games

_if only there was an 8 hour stretch of my day where the isolation and privacy of a headset was what I wanted rather than a weird curse_ wow it is working hours

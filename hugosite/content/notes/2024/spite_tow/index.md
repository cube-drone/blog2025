**the tow capacity of a Miata is a sternly worded note in the manual saying "no"**

"do not do this, it is an extremely bad idea"

of course, most folks on the internet perceive that as a challenge which is why there are loads of pictures of Miatas towing things, presumably out of spite

This might be one of my more controversial opinions, but...

JavaScript doesn't benefit much from having a whole-ass type system bolted on a la TypeScript. It's like attaching a tow-ball hitch to a Miata: just adding the capability doesn't make it practical to _use_. JavaScript is not the right environment for type safety.

If you want byzantine type safety, just program in a language that was designed from the ground up with byzantine type safety in mind, like Rust, or C#, or Scala.

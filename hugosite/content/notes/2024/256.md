there is more than one place in VRChat's backend where I set an arbitrary limit to a power-of-two because even though it's arbitrary, if I set it to that, people will assume it's for an important technical reason

modern devices basically never actually have a limit of 256 for _anything_ I think it's mostly just programmer habit at this point

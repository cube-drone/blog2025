i guess it finally happened but it actually isn't as funny as the premise would lead you to believe

they sent the host in to stop the chefs from using roasted red peppers because they're icky and I nearly yelled at the TV

on the other hand, there's a bit where Brennan keeps hauling out the very large, heavy food from the first challenge and snacking on it and that is extremely funny so ðŸ¤·

I saw someone on Mastodon pillorying someone's little personal code project for not being FOSS

ok, random stranger, I'm subtweeting you

seventeen people in all of history have ever made a profit from FOSS software, indies have it hard enough already, don't try to get them to release their source code just because you think it will probably work out for them

every FOSS monetization model:

* begging strangers for money, hoping for the best
* run it as a SAAS
* large, expensive enterprise support packages

the first one produces vanishingly low returns and the last two don't usually work for games and have you getting run out of business by Amazon

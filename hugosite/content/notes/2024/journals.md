I would sometimes make fun of video games for just leaving expository diaries all over the place but now that I've been running a Dungeons and Dragons campaign of my own for a while my players are just ass-deep in found journals.

_look, I'm not going to lie, I will fully admit that it is not in character for the Big Bad to just chronicle his evil plans in big bold letters in a little book that he keeps on his person and frequently misplaces but sometimes I'm just at a loss for how to continue_

(you need to unambiguously point players to the next major location in the story)

uh,

uh

okay, so, uh... on the goblin chieftain's dead body you find a tattered journal written in a childish hand

if y'all have great ways to deliver clear, diegetic exposition in the context of dungeons and also dragons, please

"as you stab the gelatinous cube a partially digested adventurer's journal pops out"

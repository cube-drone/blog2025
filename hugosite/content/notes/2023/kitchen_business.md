Things in a kitchen that means business:

* Loads of little bowls
* A spice grinder
* Knives on a magnetic block
* Hanging pans
* Cast iron
* A bunch of spatulas and tongs in a caddy
* Oil pours
* A pot full of salt

If you see a little Bluetooth speaker in someone’s kitchen, they either have ADHD, a bangin’ bread recipe, or both.

Of course you can cook great with 0/8 of these things, cooking is no place for gatekeepers.

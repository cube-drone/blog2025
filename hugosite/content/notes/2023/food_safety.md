_my wife made this beef stroganoff with an opened chicken broth she had been keeping in the pantry_

anyways, if I need to be hospitalized this right here is why

(**editor's note**: I was fine)

-------

As a quick guideline, here are things you can keep safely outside of the fridge after opening:

* vinegars
* oils
* dry goods
* rice, pasta
* breads, pastries
* cookies, biscuits
* (unopened) tins, jars
* jerky
* the UNNATURAL peanut butters (you know, the good ones)
* cookies, crackers
* most alcohol - excepting cream-based ones and low-proof, low-sugar ones (vermouth) which should be refrigerated

basically, if it has _no liquid_, _lots of alcohol_, _lots of sugar_, or _lots of acid_ you're usually in the clear.

Jury's kind of out on hot-sauces, ketchup and HP sauce which have a medium-high amount of sugar and acid in them: sometimes you'll see them in someone's pantry and go "ick", but it's _probably fine_.

Chicken broth, on the other hand, even with its high salt content, is basically just 'warm, nourishing liquid', you might as well put your bacteria in that agar gel that biologists use to feed it.

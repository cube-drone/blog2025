i have precisely engineered

the perfect sandwich

crisp air,

freshly showered

steam rising from my coffee

looking out the window

in my new home

at the tree

there's even a tree

an imperious chirrup from my cat

thick-cut bacon on cast iron pan

fresh tomatoes on hardwood

toasted bun, mayonnaise

lettuce, also there

it's good lettuce

let's not get too held up on the lettuce

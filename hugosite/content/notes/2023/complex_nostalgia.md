Things evoke a complicated nostalgia when they've been replaced by things that are unqualified improvements in every sense but the _technical restrictions_ of the original media fostered a unique kind of creativity or interaction that is now lost to history.

Postal mail, drive-in theaters, vinyl, pixel art, books, newspaper comics, newspapers, bbs, irc, broadcast television, fountain pens, typewriters, broadcast radio, department stores, book stores, commercial offices - while obsolete there's something lost.

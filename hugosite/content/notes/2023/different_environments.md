A _lot_ of cooking lore comes out of modern commercial kitchens and actually doesn't make a lot of sense if you're not running a restaurant.

**Restaurants** value turning out the same exact dish, every single time, like clockwork, as efficiently as possible.

**Home chefs** just want to make something delicious and actually _prefer_ if their meal is a little different each time.

**Restaurants** like chicken stock - because it's lightly flavored, versatile, and clockwork-reliable. You can trust that the stock is going to be basically identical every time you use it.

**Home chefs** like broth - when you're pulling flavor out of that chicken, toss some spices and onion chunks and whatever vegetable scraps you want in there: it's more efficient and much more delicious, and it doesn't matter if it tastes a little different every time.

**Restaurant** knife skills focus on efficiency and homogeneity: if the onions are always the same size, they always take the exact same amount of time to cook and taste the exact same.

**Home** knife skills focus on safety and ease: your goals are simply to make food smaller and not hurt yourself: however you accomplish this is fine.

Many, many home recipes are just _adapted restaurant recipes_ and it's important to be able to learn which parts of the recipe are _vital to the flavor of the dish_ and which parts are simply there for the sake of reliable, prep-friendly industrial-scale production.

**Home** chefs are adept with substitutions (you rarely need to DO a substitution in a restaurant and you OFTEN need to do it at home) and the measure of a good home cook is more "versatility" than "scale".

Speed is important, of course, in both, but what "speed" means in a restaurant and at home are totally different: speed in a restaurant means executing a complicated, complicated dish as quickly as possible with a production line of people helping and prepping, whereas speed at home mostly comes from _simplifying_.

[Adam Ragusea](https://www.youtube.com/@aragusea) and [Internet Shaquille](https://www.youtube.com/@internetshaquille), on YouTube, are a few personalities out there preaching the word of de-complicating home recipes, and it's good stuff.

A restaurant might have a guy who's job it is is to make 500 radish florets a night, which he gets extremely fast at by virtue of doing it 10,000 times a month.

A home chef might achieve a similar efficiency by simply not bothering to add an extraneous radish floret.

One _huge_ example of this in _particular_ is how many recipes call for unsalted butter, and then just _add more salt back in by hand_. That's a total "commercial kitchen" move.

But: buying just salted butter is simpler, and it lasts longer in your fridge (thanks to the preservative qualities of: salt).

If you can remember that there's about 1tsp/lb of salt in salted butter, you can only ever buy just the one butter, it'll last longer in your fridge, and it's good for all of your butter use-cases - even if you don't remember to remove an eighth of a teaspoon of salt from your recipe if it called for 1/4cup of unsalted butter.

Some parallels might be drawn between this and "small vs. large software development organizations" but they'd be pretty tortured analogies.

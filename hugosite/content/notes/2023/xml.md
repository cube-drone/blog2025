When I'm looking at the problem, specifically, of scripting video-game style dialogue, the thing I'm looking to work with is a language that allows me to _mark up_ text.

In fact, if I could _mark up_ the text in a way that's _extensible_ - with all of my weird text animations and sound effects and mood modifiers and special effects - that'd be great.

None of these formats seem to do the trick YAML isn't really a markup language at all, it's an object serialization language, same with JSON.

Why, this calls for an... extensible markup language.

I wish someone had made something like that.

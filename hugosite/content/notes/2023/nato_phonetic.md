I don't know the NATO phonetic alphabet; one time I was reading a complex serial code to someone over the phone and I just started making up words - "M as in Muffin, E as in Echo, C as in Capybara, W as in Wendigo, P as in Pterodactyl..." and they started laughing at me.

Maybe because I picked awful words, but also maybe because "Pterodactyl" very prominently has a silent P, so that's a terrible choice of word for it.

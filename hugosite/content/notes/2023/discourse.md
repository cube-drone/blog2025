Every once in a while I get a bee in my bonnet about setting up a [Discourse](https://www.discourse.org/) community without remembering that the software is the world's most effective ghost town generator.

The internet needs a modern forum software, I think. It's good that this exists: and I've been running a tiny, private Discourse community for lo, near a decade now. So, actually, I'm kind of on the side of Discourse.

Like, my Discourse site doesn't have a CDN set up. Because the CDN that I use, Cloudflare, one of the most common CDN platforms on the internet, isn't supported by Discourse. That's fine: I only have about 30 users, all of us in the Pacific Northwest, serving the whole site out of Wasabi object storage in Oregon is _perfectly fine_.  _but_ Discourse feels the need to pop up a notification _every single week_ letting me know that this is a critical error that I need to fix! **Let me live my life, Discourse.**

I'm pleased to note that at some point in the past year, Discourse has stopped bothering me about this. Hallelujiah.

I'm still weirded out by some of the ways they brand themselves and act. Discourse. A _civilized_ discussion platform. Who decided that their marketing should be dripping with, like, neo-colonial _derision_ for the way that people communicate online? That's _really baked in from the get-go, too_, all the way down to the name of the platform itself. "Discourse".

üßê Mmm, yes. Fetch me my tea, Willinglsley, it's time for a _civilized discussion_.

This isn't a place for your _memes_ and _nonsense_, this is a Serious Roman Forum for high-minded _communique_.

I can't think of a software package where I've had to disable more dubiously helpful "leave it to us, we know how to run a community better than you do" features than Discourse. "That's not enough words, you can't post a response that's just an emoji." "Oh, you need to read everything and rank up on the forum levels before you _participate_, you _neophyte_."

_obviously the problem with internet communication has always been that it's Not Polite And Erudite Enough_

_why, if we could all simply have a vigorous discussion with a polite exchange of ideas and then shake hands afterwards, what a pleasant place the internet could have become, but INSTEAD you're ignoring our civilized offerings and pelting one another with TWITCH EMOTES like a bunch of sava---_

It is simultaneously the best or second-best available FOSS community communication product (in competition with Mastodon, even though they serve different purposes) and just awkward and frustrating and disappointing in so many little ways.

I'm pleased to note that as of the most recent peek, they've completely removed the world "civilized" from their marketing materials. Consider this complaint _retracted_.

Actually, with both of the complaints of this article resolved, I'm not sure if I have anything else left to complain about.

Well, they have started cramming in worthless AI features with wild abandon, I do hate that.

Anyways: Discourse is pretty good I guess?

i've been walking-and-reading-at-the-same-time conversantly since I was 8 years old

now, let me tell you what I can't do: I can't _bicycle_ and read at the same time

the one time I tried I sent myself flying over the hood of a car

now

I'm pretty sure that wasn't my fault, it was the fault of the car's driver

you know,

for parking there

-----

I went on a 90 minute walk today, up to a park near the top of the big hill I live on, and came home

Tiff: "So, did you like the park?"

Me: "Enh, by the time I got to the park I'd been walking for 45 minutes and it was starting to rain, so I just decided to head back home."

Tiff: "So you didn't get to read then?"

Me: "Oh, no, I was reading the whole way."

Tiff: "How?"

Me: "I read and walk."

Tiff: "You can't."

Me: "Sure I can."

Tiff: "Those things are mutually exclusive."

Me: "Wrong!"

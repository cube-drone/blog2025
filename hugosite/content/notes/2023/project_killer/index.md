So, I had a neat idea of something I could do with a game I was working on: take
the 2D plane the game was running on and stack it on a 3D plane, so that the game would visibly
take place on a screen in a different, 3D world.

I whipped up a quick demo:

**2025 Editor's Note:**

In retrospect, this _neat idea_ was actually the worst kind of idea: a total project killer.

It sucked up a bunch of time and air, and obviously I lack the experience and chops to build a viable full 3D game:
so chasing this idea would be impractical.

Something about the _mere existence_ of this 2D/3D divide ended up drawing a lot of focus and thought, but
it was so obviously impractical that the project couldn't continue. Rather than rolling it back and continuing
with an earlier build, I simply moved on to the next idea.

This was the last time I ever posted about this project.

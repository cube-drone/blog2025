Every time I burn myself (and it's pretty often, I cook and am clumsy) I run cold water on the burn, which is what you're supposed to do for not terribly serious burns to keep any further damage from setting in. It also feels nice.

Thing is, that _mostly_ stops it from hurting until the hand dries completely.

This will keep working for _hours_, if you want it to. If you want to avoid feeling the pain from the burn, you can just keep your hand wet for, like, 8 solid hours. But if you _ever_ stop with the cold water, it starts to hurt again. If you just tough it out through that phase for, like, five minutes, it won't be so bad, but... well, when do you want to do that?

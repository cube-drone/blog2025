In "Race to El Dorado" the powerful Scientist card allows you to make your deck (of explorers) more efficient by removing (less powerful ones) them from your deck, so when we played we'd describe all of the fanciful ways that the Scientist would accidentally or intentionally kill his fellow adventurers.

**"Bosewick! I need you to investigate those vines over there. Oh my, Bosewick, you've been consumed! Fascinating."**

Near the end of the game it had happened a lot, so every time someone's Scientist cleared a card out of their deck the _whole table_ would go "HUP!", which was the sound of the now increasingly buff and unhinged Scientist just picking up one of his compatriots under the armpits like a baby and tossing them into the nearest ravine. **HUP!**

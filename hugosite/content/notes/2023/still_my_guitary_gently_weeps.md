if you look at the floor and see it needs sweeping but *still* your guitar gently weeps, you have confused your guitar and broom.

this is a common problem.

despite what you might think, it can not be resolved with a blistering solo.

you need to put down the guitar and fetch a broom. you can't solo dust away.

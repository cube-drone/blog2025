If I could find some way to legally churn kittens and orphans into high-yield fertilizer in a way that was profitable, I'd be drowning in VC capital and employees by the end of the week.

People clown on silicon valley's "if we don't build it, someone else will, might as well get to work building the evil thing" ethos but it's not necessarily WRONG.

You don't have to participate in it, you probably shouldn't if it morally disgusts you, but if a profitable market opportunity exists, no matter how evil, there's no shortage of people out there who will cheerfully fill it. They'll rationalize it to themselves one way or another - "well, we design land mines but we don't DEPLOY them" - "our vapes are helping people _stop_ smoking" - "microtransactions are the only way to sustain a live service game" - if there's profit on the line they'll find a way.

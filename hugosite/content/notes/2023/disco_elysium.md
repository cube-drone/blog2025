the thing about Disco Elysium is that it's very good, so I've been playing it until slightly too late at night and then waking up, underslept, with a headache, feeling like shit, with no recollection of the previous day's events, which is _fantastically immersive into the game's universe_.

I'm almost 40, so "waking up feeling like warmed over death" doesn't take a bender, it basically just requires that I get 30 minutes less sleep than usual.

I'll tell you this about Disco: Elysium

it's the most Planescape: Torment game ever made

"What about the classic, well-reviewed, critical darling, Planescape: Torment?" you might ask

and no, Disco Elysium is even more Planescape: Torment even than that.

look, I want to try the [Rancho Gordo heirloom beans](https://www.ranchogordo.com/) that all the food bloggers are talking about but if you factor in S&H to Canada and the exchange rate, I'd be paying in the realm of $15/lb for them and that is just too much money for dried beans.

Like, I pay $11/lb for pretty good *coffee* beans and those are the Most Special Beans

(If you're american they come in at ~$7/lb which is still exorbitant for dried beans, but _less so_)

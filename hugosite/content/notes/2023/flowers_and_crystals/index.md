I'm a big believer in the healing power of flowers and crystals.

but by "healing" I mean "healing my hunger" and by flowers I mean "sunflowers, specifically the oil from sunflowers", and by "crystals" I mean "one very specific kind of crystal" and by "one very specific kind of crystal" I mean "salt"

also potatoes are involved

okay, I'm just gonna say it, I'm a big believer in the power of potato chips

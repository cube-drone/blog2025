Rereading [Bone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bone_(comics)) for the first time in a decade, I'm a little stunned that there's a color edition of this out there. So much of the artistry of this series is in how deftly it uses _just_ black and white.

Go read Bone. Read it in black and white. Share it with your kids.

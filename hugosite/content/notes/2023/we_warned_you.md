Sometimes when something bad happens, somebody will make a post on social media like "we warned you, we warned you this was going to happen and you didn't listen" - with "you" as a kind of abstract _other person_.

It does numbers because, I guess, people would rather feel like they're aligned with the "we" than with the "you" in that sentiment. Yeah, (_awkwardly_), we ... did warn you! You tell 'em! [We're all trying to find the guy who did this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLfAf8oHrMo).

I usually unfollow everybody involved in that kind of transaction because _none of that_ is a good energy to bring to social media.

[Avenue 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avenue_5) nailed this, with a deck filled with attractive, well-dressed actors pretending to work on a bunch of high-tech-looking panels for the sake of the company's image while the actual engineers worked on a bunch of regular computers in a dingy, crowded, messy office.

_as a dumpy ADHD man who wears a robe for most of the day and who has built a tremendous amount of real actual software I feel like if I had to operate in a traditional corporate environment, having a productive looking actor representing me would actually be a real career boon_

**pretty sure we'd be VP of Engineering before long**

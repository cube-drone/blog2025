Despite very limited viewership numbers, my new blog, “Catering To The Viewpoints  of Rich, Sour, Aggrieved Old White Dads” is finding no trouble getting financial backers: my new blog post “Let’s All Shut Up About Trans People And Talk About My Trans-Am” made CTTVoRSAOWD enough money to keep me in good cheese for months.

Working on “Nirvana is the Greatest Band of All Time And Their Songs Really Resonate With My Struggles As a Landlord” to try to get my hands on some of that sweet Gen-X generational wealth.

I’m thinking of changing the title to something that appeals to both fragile masculinity and a hearkening back to weird old military-industrial boot licking, like maybe “The Hawkeye Report with Brett Bullett".

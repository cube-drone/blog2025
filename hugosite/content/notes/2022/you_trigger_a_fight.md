you trigger a fight with **man who overestimated how many groceries he can carry home**

watch out, he's one of the slowest opponents in the game but if he can extricate his welt-crossed hands from his bags he can do big damage with his bottomless inventory and the Throw command

you trigger a fight with **the boys in the bright white sports car**

_the boys are waving their hands in the air_

_who do they think they are?!?_

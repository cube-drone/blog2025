What's curious is that nobody has pitched a Muppet movie on the internet yet that I wouldn't watch.

A Muppet fantasy RPG where Muppets gather around a RPG table but all of their actions are performed by live-action actors, with The Rock voiced by Ms. Piggy? Sold.

Muppet Dune? Sign me up.

A Muppet adaptation of the Muppet Christmas Carol called "The Muppet Muppet Christmas Carol" where they re-do the Muppet Christmas Carol but with more Muppets? Absolutely

Muppet 1984? Why not?

Actually I might veto any big Muppet fantasy projects like LoTR because the Jim Henson company might lean into their Dark Crystal collection a bit and nobody needs any more of those creepy expressionless indistinguishable Brian Froud waifs.

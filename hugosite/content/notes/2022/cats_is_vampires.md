* keep themselves immaculately coiffed
* recreationally do murders for the sheer thrill of the hunt
* sometimes very friendly, sometimes very cold
* sleep all day
* prominent fangs
* will hiss at you dramatically if threatened
* even if they love you, they will bite you if they get too excited, they can't help it
* mweh!

evidence is mounting that vampires and cats are beloved for many of the same reasons

basically I'm laying out the argument for why "Prince Alastair: Catboy Vampire" would be the most shipped character ever written

Cats treat dogs basically the same way that vampires treat werewolves, I'm telling you, vampires is just cats.

Do you know that part of Castlevania where Dracula dramatically throws a wine glass on to the ground and it shatters?

Total cat move.

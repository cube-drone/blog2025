for a tale of top-notch unclery

my nephew was fiddling with a voice recording interface that had a "reverse" button

so I say "watch this"

and I record myself going "ynreh olleh" a few times

and he looks at me like a crazy person because I am speaking gibberish

then I click the reverse button

and it **works**

My experience of being broadly creative but not overwhelmingly talented is one of tremendous, unending shame.

How dare I produce such shoddy trash? How dare I presume that any of my output is worth others' time and attention?

I deserve my relative anonymity.

This is tempered by what I would describe as "grim defiance". God damn you, I will reach deep down and I will produce more trash than you had ever thought possible, and I will press it right into your goddamned faces until you love me.
